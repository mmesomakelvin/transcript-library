# Source Repo Sync Contract

This document defines the supported boundary between the upstream `playlist-transcripts` repository and Transcript Library.

## Contract Summary

- **Upstream `playlist-transcripts` owns ingestion and commits.** It pulls playlist changes, writes transcript files, rebuilds its transcript index, and pushes git commits.
- **Transcript Library owns refreshing its local checkout.** It fast-forwards the local `PLAYLIST_TRANSCRIPTS_REPO` checkout, rebuilds SQLite from that checkout, and records refresh evidence beside the catalog.
- **Refresh is refresh-only.** It updates source state and browse state; it does **not** start analysis work.
- **The unattended default is the daily operational sweep.** Operators schedule `node --import tsx scripts/daily-operational-sweep.ts`, which runs the supported refresh authority first and then only the conservative historical repair pass.
- **Analysis remains on-demand.** Users start it from `/api/analyze`, or operators trigger it through explicit analysis workflows when they intentionally want analysis work.

If you need new browse content to appear automatically, use the refresh entrypoints below or schedule the daily sweep that wraps refresh plus safe repair. If you need AI artifacts for a video, run an analysis workflow separately.

## Supported Repository Shape

Hosted and unattended use assume `PLAYLIST_TRANSCRIPTS_REPO` points to an app-owned local git checkout with this shape:

```text
PLAYLIST_TRANSCRIPTS_REPO/
  .git/
  youtube-transcripts/
    index/
      videos.csv
    <slug>/
      main.md
      ...
```

Required assumptions:

- `PLAYLIST_TRANSCRIPTS_REPO` is an **absolute path**.
- It is a **git worktree/checkout**, not just a copied directory.
- The app can run `git fetch` and `git merge --ff-only` there.
- If the checkout is ever detached HEAD, set `PLAYLIST_TRANSCRIPTS_BRANCH` explicitly.
- `PLAYLIST_TRANSCRIPTS_REMOTE` defaults to `origin` if unset.
- `PLAYLIST_TRANSCRIPTS_BRANCH` defaults to the current checked-out branch, or `master` when the checkout is detached and no branch is configured.

Why this matters:

- Browse and search read from SQLite built from `videos.csv`.
- Raw transcript reads (`/api/raw`) read directly from `PLAYLIST_TRANSCRIPTS_REPO`.
- A stale or non-git directory makes both surfaces lie differently.

## What Refresh Actually Does

The refresh contract is implemented by `src/lib/source-refresh.ts` and exposed through two supported entrypoints:

### 1. Operator CLI

```bash
node --import tsx scripts/refresh-source-catalog.ts
node --import tsx scripts/refresh-source-catalog.ts --check
```

Behavior:

1. inspect the configured transcript checkout
2. `git fetch` the configured remote/branch
3. fast-forward the local checkout with `git merge --ff-only`
4. rebuild the SQLite catalog from `videos.csv`
5. write durable refresh evidence to `last-source-refresh.json`
6. preserve the last known-good catalog proof if the rebuild fails

`--check` still performs the source refresh, but validates the catalog rebuild in check-only mode instead of publishing a new live SQLite database.

### 2. Hosted/Webhook Entry Point

```http
POST /api/sync-hook
Authorization: Bearer <SYNC_TOKEN or PRIVATE_API_TOKEN>
```

Behavior:

- Uses the same refresh authority as the CLI.
- Accepts `SYNC_TOKEN` for dedicated webhook callers.
- Also accepts `PRIVATE_API_TOKEN` as the hosted private-boundary override.
- Records request identity metadata in the refresh record.
- Returns refresh outcomes (`updated`, `noop`, `failed`) instead of analysis batch submission details.

Important hosted boundary:

- `library.aojdevstudio.me` is the **friend-facing** Cloudflare Access hostname.
- That hostname is for approved-human browser access to the app and its browser-driven API calls.
- Do **not** assume a bearer token alone is a supported way to reach browser routes on that hostname.
- `/api/sync-hook` is the supported bearer-based machine entrypoint, not the model for the whole browser surface.

## Daily Sweep Layered on Top of Refresh

When operators want one unattended command, schedule:

```bash
node --import tsx scripts/daily-operational-sweep.ts
```

The daily sweep keeps the refresh contract intact:

1. run the supported source refresh authority
2. run the conservative historical repair pass
3. write durable sweep evidence to `data/runtime/daily-operational-sweep/latest.json`
4. archive the full per-run record at `data/runtime/daily-operational-sweep/archive/<sweepId>.json`

The sweep outcome is `clean`, `repaired`, `manual-follow-up`, or `failed`.

If `manualFollowUpVideoIds` is non-empty, those videos need manual follow-up because the sweep saw a
rerun-only mismatch such as `artifacts-without-run`. That is an intentional stop signal: the sweep
leaves those videos visible for an explicit rerun and does not fabricate missing run history or auto-start analysis.

## What Refresh Does **Not** Do

Refresh does **not**:

- queue or start AI analysis
- create `data/insights/<videoId>/run.json`
- create `status.json` for new videos
- call provider CLIs
- synthesize analysis artifacts just because a transcript commit landed upstream

That separation is intentional. Source refresh keeps browse state current. Analysis remains on-demand.

## Evidence Files and Inspection Commands

Refresh evidence lives beside the catalog, usually under `data/catalog/` unless `CATALOG_DB_PATH` points elsewhere.

### Durable evidence files

- `last-source-refresh.json` — the source-refresh authority record
- `last-import-validation.json` — the catalog publish/check proof paired with the refresh record

### `last-source-refresh.json` tells you

- refresh `outcome`: `updated`, `noop`, or `failed`
- failing `phase`: `repo-inspect`, `git-fetch`, `git-fast-forward`, `catalog-rebuild`, or `completed`
- `headBefore`, `headAfter`, and `upstreamHead`
- configured `remote` and `branch`
- trigger source: `cli` or `sync-hook`
- request identity metadata for webhook-triggered refreshes
- whether the catalog rebuild was `checkOnly`
- whether the last known-good validation proof was preserved

### Inspect the latest refresh

```bash
node --import tsx scripts/refresh-source-catalog.ts --check
cat data/catalog/last-source-refresh.json
cat data/catalog/last-import-validation.json
```

If `CATALOG_DB_PATH` is set, inspect the sibling files next to that configured database path instead of `data/catalog/`.

### Interpret the outcomes

#### Success with source change

- `outcome: "updated"`
- `phase: "completed"`
- `headBefore != headAfter`
- `headAfter == upstreamHead`

Meaning: the local checkout advanced and the catalog rebuild finished.

#### Success with no upstream change

- `outcome: "noop"`
- `phase: "completed"`
- `headBefore == headAfter == upstreamHead`

Meaning: the refresh entrypoint ran correctly, but there was nothing new to publish.

#### Failure before source movement

- `outcome: "failed"`
- `phase: "repo-inspect"` or `phase: "git-fetch"`

Meaning: the checkout shape or remote update failed before the app could move the local repo.

#### Failure after source movement but before browse publish

- `outcome: "failed"`
- `phase: "git-fast-forward"` or `phase: "catalog-rebuild"`

Meaning: source refresh did not reach a new stable browse snapshot. Inspect both evidence files and resolve the underlying git/catalog issue.

## Hosted Preflight Expectations

In hosted mode (`HOSTED=true`), startup preflight now checks more than variable presence:

- `PLAYLIST_TRANSCRIPTS_REPO` must be configured
- it must be an absolute path
- it must exist and be a git checkout
- detached HEAD without `PLAYLIST_TRANSCRIPTS_BRANCH` produces a warning
- missing `last-source-refresh.json` produces a warning
- missing `last-import-validation.json` produces a warning
- missing `SYNC_TOKEN` produces a warning because dedicated webhook callers will get `503` unless they use `PRIVATE_API_TOKEN`

This is a startup-visible contract. The goal is to fail or warn before operators discover stale browse content later.

## Hosted Topologies

The hosted contract now has one explicit split:

### Human browser access

- `https://library.aojdevstudio.me` is the **friend-facing** hostname.
- Cloudflare Access is the browser identity system on that hostname.
- Browser API calls rely on Cloudflare-managed identity reaching the origin guard; the app does **not** issue browser secrets, passwords, or bearer tokens.
- Routes used by the video workspace (`/api/insight`, `/api/analyze`, `/api/insight/stream`) are expected to work for approved friends through that browser identity shape.

### Machine access

Supported machine entrypoints stay explicit and narrow:

1. **Same-machine automation**
   - Prefer cron/systemd on the app host to run:

   ```bash
   cd /opt/transcript-library/current
   node --import tsx scripts/daily-operational-sweep.ts
   ```

   - Use this when the app host is responsible for unattended refresh-only ingest plus the conservative historical repair pass.
   - Inspect `data/runtime/daily-operational-sweep/latest.json` (or the sibling `runtime/` tree next to `INSIGHTS_BASE_DIR`) after each run; if `manualFollowUpVideoIds` is non-empty, those rerun-only videos need explicit operator follow-up and analysis remains on-demand.

2. **External refresh automation crossing the edge**
   - Call `POST /api/sync-hook` with `Authorization: Bearer <SYNC_TOKEN>`.
   - `PRIVATE_API_TOKEN` remains a broader hosted override, but treat it as an operator-controlled machine token, not a browser credential.
   - If the caller must traverse Cloudflare to reach the origin, protect that automation path with a Cloudflare service token or place it on a dedicated automation hostname instead of assuming the friend-facing Access hostname accepts bearer-only callers.

3. **Deploy automation**
   - Use a dedicated deploy hostname such as `library-deploy.aojdevstudio.me` for deploy hooks and other unattended machine-only ingress.
   - Keep that hostname outside the friend-facing OTP/browser flow and secure it with webhook signature verification plus optional Cloudflare service-token policy when the caller is not already constrained another way.

For hosted deployment, do **not** rely on the historical `http://localhost:3939/api/sync-hook` callback assumption from upstream scripts unless the caller really is running on the same machine and port layout.

## Troubleshooting

### Startup warns that refresh evidence files are missing

Cause: the host has never completed a refresh/rebuild in this runtime location.

Fix:

```bash
node --import tsx scripts/refresh-source-catalog.ts --check
node --import tsx scripts/refresh-source-catalog.ts
```

### Startup fails because the transcript repo is not a git checkout

Cause: `PLAYLIST_TRANSCRIPTS_REPO` points at a copied directory, wrong path, or partially mounted volume.

Fix: point it at the persistent local clone/worktree the app is allowed to fast-forward.

### Refresh succeeds but there are still no analysis artifacts for the new video

That is expected. Refresh is refresh-only. Start analysis explicitly with `/api/analyze` or the operator analysis workflow you intend to use.

### Refresh fails after a catalog rebuild attempt

Inspect:

- `last-source-refresh.json`
- `last-import-validation.json`
- the refresh CLI output

The refresh record preserves the failure phase and whether the last known-good validation proof was kept in place.
