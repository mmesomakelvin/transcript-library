Ralph Wigum is absolutely blowing up. We
made a video about it last year and
since then it's all anyone is talking
about on Twitter. Matt PCO has made
loads of videos on it. Ryan Carson has
written a very popular article on it and
Rasmike has built on it with his Ralphie
bash script. But is everyone doing it
wrong? The creator has already said that
some implementations are incorrect. So
what's the correct way to do it? And why
is Ralph currently the best way to build
software with AI? Hit subscribe and
let's get into it.
The Ralph loop was created by Jeff
Huntley and written about way back in
June last year. It is essentially a bash
loop that gives an AI agent the exact
same prompt over and over again. But
it's genius on so many levels because it
lets the AI agent work in its smartest
mode, which is the mode where it has as
little context as possible. Take a look
at this. So let's imagine this is the
total context window for an agent. From
zero to about 30% is what we'll call the
smart zone, which is where the agent
performs the best. From about 30 to 60%,
it still performs really well. And from
60% onwards, so 60, 70, 80, 90, that's
when it starts to degrade. We'll call it
the dumb zone. Now, these numbers aren't
set in stone and could be different per
model. So the smart zone for a certain
model could be 40, 50%, but usually over
80% context window, that's when the
dumbness starts to begin. So for Claude
Summit or Opus, the typical tokens for a
context window is 200,000. So we can say
the first 60 is the smart zone. The next
60 is still okay, but not as good as the
first 60k tokens. And then the last 80k,
it doesn't seem to perform as well. Now
this is my personal experience with this
model. You might have had other
experiences. And the reason for this is
because the model itself is what we call
auto reggressive. Meaning it has to look
at the previous tokens to predict the
next one. And if you have loads and
loads of tokens, it has to go through a
lot of them to find out the important
bits that are relevant to the next task
at hand. Now, let's focus on the first
30%. Even before you write your first
prompt, there are some things that get
added to the context window
automatically. First is the system
prompt and then the system tools. These
on a typical claude model take 8.3% and
1.4% of the context. So almost 10% of
this 30. And then if you have skills
that can get added and also if you have
custom MCP tools. Finally, if you have
an agent MD file, that gets added, too.
And the larger, of course, for any of
these things. So, the larger the MD
file, the more tokens it will take up.
And this is all even before you've added
your own prompt. So, in general, it's
best to keep this section as small as
possible. So, have less tools, have less
skills, and have less in your agent MD
file so that the model is working at its
most optimum context. And to get an idea
of exactly how much 60k is, if we were
to get the whole script of Star Wars a
new hope, that is about 54,000 tokens in
GPT5. So roughly this amount. Now you
may be wondering what about compaction?
Can that help with this whole process?
And we'll talk about that a bit later.
But now let's move on to exactly how
Ralph can help with this. So the benefit
of Ralph is that you focus on one goal
per context window. So the whole 200k
context window, we can dedicate that to
one goal or one task. And the way we do
that is we write a prompt that will
first say inspect the plan MD file. This
contains the tasks to be done. So
something like create the front end,
create the back end, do the database and
so on. That is a very high level
example. Of course, you'd go way more
detailed if you were doing Ralph and
more granular, but we'll stick with that
example for now. So this prompt will
tell the agents to pick the most
important task, then make those changes.
After making those changes, run and even
push and commit those changes as well as
doing a test. And once you're done with
those, once the tests have passed, then
tick the task as done in the plan ND
file and do that again. So the agent
will keep looking for the most important
task to do until it's completed all the
tasks. Now, actually, let me take that
back because you could keep having the
Ralph loop go over and over again even
if it has completed all the tasks. And
the benefit of that is that it may even
find things to fix or find features to
add that don't exist in the plan and
defile. But if it is going off the
rails, the benefit of having Ralph is
that you can stop the whole process
whenever you want, adjust the prompt MD
file and then run the whole process
again. And Ralph makes this so simple
because this whole process is executed
in one single bash while loop. So here
it just catchs the prompt MD file. So
prints it to the agent and then runs
claude in yolo mode. Of course, the flag
isn't yolo. It's dangerously skip
permissions, but for the sake of space,
I've kept it short. And what makes Ralph
special is that it's outside of the
model's control. So the model can't
control when to stop Ralph. It will just
keep going. And that way you can ensure
that when a new task runs or when a new
prompt is triggered, the context, so
here is pretty much where it is when you
first open the agent. So this is fresh.
It doesn't have any compaction. It
doesn't have anything added. So each new
task gets the most amount of context and
uses the model in its most smart or most
optimal context window stage. Basically,
compaction is where the agent will look
at all the tokens that have been written
in the context window and pick out the
most important bits for the next prompt.
So, it will pick what it thinks is most
important, but it doesn't know what is
actually most important. Therefore,
compaction might lose some critical
information and make your project not
work as expected. Anyway, now that we've
seen the canonical Ralph loop
implementation from the creator, this
helps us see why other implementations
are different. Let's take a look at the
anthropic implementation, which uses a
slash command to run Ralph inside of
Claude's code, has max iterations, and a
completion promise. So, the problem with
this specific Ralph Wigan plug-in is the
fact that it compacts the information
when it's moving on to the next task.
So, if it finishes one task and reruns
the prompt instead of completely
resetting the context window, it
compacts what was previously done,
therefore could lose some vital
information. There's also the slight
issue of having max iterations and a
completion promise because sometimes
it's nice to just let Ralph keep going.
It can find very interesting things to
fix that you wouldn't have thought of
before. And if you watch it, so be a
human on the loop, you may see patterns,
good or bad, from a specific model that
you can tweak and enhance in your
original prompt. If we take a look at
Ryan Carson's approach to the Ralph
loop, we can see here that it's not
quite canonical simply because on each
loop, it has the possibility of
adjusting or adding to the agents.mmd
file. Now, depending on the system
prompt or any user prompts you've added
to the model, in my experience, by
default, models can be very wordy. And
so, if on each iteration you're adding
to the agents file, which gets added to
the context at the beginning of each
user prompt, then you're just adding
more tokens into the context window,
pushing the model into a place where it
could potentially give you dumb results.
But the fact that people are making
their own scripts from the basic Ralph
loop bash script is a testament to how
simple and easy it is to understand. And
although there is a canonical way of
doing Ralph, I think it's okay for
developers, teams, and companies to
tweak it to their specific use case. For
example, I love the fact that in Raz
Mike's Ralphy script, there's a way to
run parallel Ralphs and also the fact
that you can use the agent browser tool
from Vel to do browser testing. I also
love the fact that in Matt Perox's
version of Ralph, he adds tasks or
things to do as GitHub issues and the
Ralph loop will pick the most important
one, work on it, and mark it as done
when it's complete before working on the
next one, which I think is really
clever. I think the power and simplicity
of Ralph means that it's going to stick
around for a very long time, and you
also may see a lot of iterations and
improvements from it. I really like the
way Jeffree is taking this with his Loom
and Weaver project where he wants to
create a way to make software
autonomously and correctly. But with all
these Ralphs autonomously creating new
software, you need a way to search for
errors and make sure they get fixed.
This is where Better Stack comes in
because not only can it ingest logs and
filter out errors from them, but it can
also handle error tracking on the front
end. So with this MCP server, you can
ask an agent to specifically pick out
errors from the front end or back end
instead of reading through the whole
log, which in turn reduces the context
window. So go and check out better stack
and let me know what you think in the
comments.
