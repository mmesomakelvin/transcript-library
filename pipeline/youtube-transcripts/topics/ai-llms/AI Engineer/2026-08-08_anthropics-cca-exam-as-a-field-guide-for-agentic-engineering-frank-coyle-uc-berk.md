&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm getting rolling and uh welcome
aboard. We just had a little technical
issues,
but uh we resolved them. So, my name is
Frank Coyle.
Uh I am a computer science guy. I've
been teaching computer science for over
30 years,
and I'm now teaching at Berkeley. And
one of the problems that uh all my
students,
past and present, are having is AI,
because computer science is no longer
the magic pathway to a job. So, I've
been trying to figure out ways to uh
help them come up with schemes to help
them get ready for this world of agentic
AI. And one of the things that sort of
uh
dropped into my uh plate was the
something called the Claude Certified
Architect exam, which I will be talking
about today, and it has um a number of
aspects to it. And I think if you're
interested in a career in agentic AI,
then certainly take a look at least what
the exam is about, because I feel that
um Anthropic knows how people are using
their system and what the issues are
going to be.
So, before we jump into that, I want to
give a little bit of my
uh
my philosophy.
bop bop bop bop
May have to do this manually, getting
stuck.
So,
this is a quote from uh
a woman named Sister Corita Kent.
Nothing is a mistake. There's no win and
no fail. There's only make.
Bottom line here is experiment,
experiment, experiment. Not only should
you read, but you should do. You should
make stuff. Now, what happens when you
make stuff? A lot of times things don't
work.
Thomas Edison said, "I have not failed.
I've only found 10,000 ways
that don't work."
And
what I want to emphasize here is that
what this shows us are something that in
the design patterns movement, which came
around in the early 1990s with
object-oriented programming, we had
patterns for objects. We now have
patterns for agents, but there's also
anti-patterns. And I think anti-patterns
are a key
to understanding what you should not do
because understanding what you should
not do is the key to leading you to what
you should do.
So, a little bit about the Claude
Certified Exam, released in March, so
it's brand new.
It is uh
it is
based on scenarios. It is timed. It is
proctored.
It is available to companies in the
Claude ecosystem, the Anthropic
ecosystem, but individuals can pay $99
and take the exam once every once every
6 months.
And it's not just
multiple-choice questions. It is
multiple-choice, but they're
they are based on
uh realistic constraints and realistic
scenarios.
The five domains.
There are five domains that are covered
and they give you the percentages of
each. So, agentic architecture, 27%.
Claude code, how to configure the Claude
code system and workflow, 20%. How to
doing prompt engineering, structuring
your output, using JSON all over the
place.
Tool design. Model context protocol
integration. These are topics that you
should understand and know whether
you're going to take the exam or not.
This is going to help you get ready for
whatever
the agentic world is going to throw at
you. And then there's going to be
contact management and reliability. So
these are the
areas of of the kind of questions you're
going to run into.
Then there are and they they provide you
with six production scenarios and your
the exam will randomly choose four and
all the questions will be centered
around the four that they choose.
And what I'm going to do is walk you
through
um
the production scenarios and give you
some anti-patterns to be aware of
because there's a number of ways you can
solve the problem but one of the big
things is what not to do and that often
can be the key to getting these
questions right. So, number one customer
support resolution agent. So we have
agentic loops, control, something called
stop reason which is
uh what Cloud Code has. Every time
something happens, there's a stop reason
and you need to take a look at that
because that can give you a lot of
information about what's going on.
Uh scenario two, code generation.
Three, multi-agent research system which
we'll look at. How do you How do you
distribute your agents? Hub and spoke.
Who's the orchestrator? How much
information should they know? All these
are important factors. Um
scenario four, developer
productivity with code. So how do you do
subtask isolation? Keep your tasks in
their little universes. And this
hearkens back to what we learn in
computer science from doing
multi-threaded programming.
When you have multiple threads operating
and sharing memory, then you get into
issues with synchronization. You You to
put locks
Keep the little threads independent.
Keep your agents independent.
Um
and then some cloud code for continuous
integration.
And then we'll look at some patterns for
structured data extraction. Okay, that's
kind of where we're going to go.
Now, here's something that I I I like to
point out. Everybody's talking about
loops, right? Every The loop is the new
thing.
Um
uh Boris Cherney says he doesn't write
code, but his job is to write loops.
And Peter Steinberger
master of Open Claw says, "I don't I
don't uh I don't code anymore. I just
design loops
that prompt your agents."
So, loops are the new big thing, right?
Well, no, they're not. Okay? Um
back in the day
uh early days of computing, we had
programming languages were exploding. We
had Fortran, we had COBOL, and there
were big fights. My program My
programming language is better than
yours. It can do more. No, it can't. We
can do this.
Böhm and Jacopini, 1966
proved that if you want a language to be
Turing complete, which means can compute
anything that computers are possibly
able to compute, then you need only
three things.
The ability to
to to write statements sequentially,
okay?
To have if-then conditionals, and the
third piece is the loop.
If you add the loop,
you have Turing computability. And now
we are seeing this being resurrected in
the agentic world with the focus on
loops, cuz up to now we've had sort of
sequences. You have prompts, you have
maybe if-then, but now we have a loop.
And now this is what's giving us the
power. This is where the agentic stuff
is getting very exciting.
Okay.
I'm start with uh
with scenario one, customer support
resolution.
So here we have
a loop operating and
the I'm going to jump to the
anti-pattern. What you don't want is
just to let the agent go and do
something and get the response back and
use it, okay? What you want to do is you
want to loop with something called the
stop reason. So I'm going to show you a
little code here.
So here we have while loop. It's a while
true, it's a loop. We're looping right
here, okay? So the first little block is
where we call uh we call the model,
okay? And we pass it the messages. The
messages are essentially the sequence of
prompts that exist in the context
window, okay? And we are asking the and
we have a we have a prompt and we have
we have the context and we have a tool.
And we're asking the LLM
to do something with this tool and help
us out. The problem is the LLM can't do
anything. It is just a probabilistic
next word predictor.
It can't execute tools. So what it does
though is it can figure out
if you point it to a tool, it can figure
out how to set things up so that you or
your code can execute it. So it's
important to understand that the LLM is
not executing these tools. It can't do
anything except talk back to you, very
intelligently sometimes, but all it can
do is talk back to you. So
when it finishes
this
task and has a result which is basically
here is I've I know what you want. I
know what the tool can do. Here's how I
It sets up the parameters that can then
be or that then used to actually execute
the tool. So, the second block you see
why did
the LLM come back to us? That's our stop
reason.
Tool use. Oh, okay. We've stopped
because
the LLM it wants to use the tool.
So, let's just run the tool. So, that's
what the second block is. Run tool, the
response is what the LLM said, and it's
basically the parameters that it has
extracted from the data that you
provided it.
Okay? Then it executes that.
Then it goes back.
That then it continues. Continues means
the LLM sees it and says, "Oh,
successful run. So, okay."
Come back down.
We're not running a tool anymore. We're
end the end of our loop. Bingo.
Now,
then we take the answer, and this is an
opportunity for you to
have a human in the loop potentially.
You check the confidence. If it looks
good, you keep it. If you don't, then
you escalate to a human.
So, now there's another reason why you
need to make sure you check your stop
reason. One of the stop reasons may be
you have run out of tokens, and this
response is based on partial when the
LLM had to stop.
And it's going to give you a response,
but if you have run out of tokens, then
you need to take action.
Okay.
Um
Next scenario.
Uh code generation with Claude. So,
Claude code has this has this concept of
the Claude MD file, a markdown file,
where you put all the things you wanted
to know.
What Anthropic recommends is you have
three levels of Claude.
One
that you have at the top level of your
project,
the other that you have in inside your
sort of the project folder, and then
within directories you can also specify.
So, the idea is to have a hierarchical
set of rules that that can then control
how the system is going to respond.
Okay.
Moving right along,
uh we have a multi-agent research
system. So, here we're going to have uh
the problem is
how do I how do I get my agents to to go
off and do stuff and bring the answers
back in a reasonable way? The
anti-pattern
you
have one agent and you load it up with
tools, all right? So, I like to think
about you
you know, you hire somebody to come to
your house, you hire a carpenter to come
to the house, and the guy shows up with
uh
plumbing tools, carpenter tools,
electrical tools. He says, "I can do
anything." Well, maybe you don't want
this guy, maybe you want a a
professional carpenter. So, that's the
kind of idea. And this kind of back
takes us back to some of the the
functional programming
uh
ideas that functions should be do one
thing. And if you can get your agents to
do one thing,
you with maybe one or two tools
available to it, then that's going to be
a win, and that's going to help you with
this exam. So, specialize,
don't overload.
The other part of this is
don't let your agents
context spill over into the main context
because context means tokens, tokens
mean money,
and the more context you have, the more
confused the LLM is going to be in
giving you an answer. So, even though
oh, a million token context window, I
can put everything in there. No, no,
don't put everything in there.
Limit what's going to go in there
because then you're going to get
a much more accurate system.
So, here's a
Here's an example of a specialized sub
agents.
You're giving it
So, this would be the critic. So, let's
say you've run some stuff. Now, you want
to get an agent to look at what's
happened. What you want to do is just
give it what it needs to solve that
critic problem. I'm only giving it here
the
we're passing it
the claim and the evidence. So, this is
your claim is sort of how we're going to
solve the problem. Here's Here's the
evidence, but we're not giving it the
the thought processes that went in to
creating this claim. Why?
When you
When you get a bunch of agents together
collaborating and talking to each other,
there's a tendency to have group think.
And
all the agents seem to kind of devolve
into one idea. I mean, it's it's like,
you know, you're in a group, you know,
you're at a party, and everybody wants
pizza except you, but then people talk
you into
you you know, you don't want to be uh
you don't want to spoil the party, so
you'll go along. And it seems that
agents kind of work in the same way.
So, you're going to return
Basically, you're going to give each
agent only a slice. I didn't think about
the pizza analogy, but yes. Every agent
gets its own slice, and and it it should
come through.
Okay.
Fourth scenario,
developer productivity. So, the
anti-pattern.
Let every subtask dump its full output
into the primary thread, crowding out
the context. Again, this is what we're I
was just talking about. This is bad. Let
the context grow unbounded. Bad, right?
For the reasons we just talked about.
You want to isolate your subtask output,
and you want to compact
long sessions. I'm going to take a
second to talk about that. So, here's
here's a
an example of a pattern.
Uh
you want to have your agent
uh
look at the logs and create a summary
of where the problems are in the log.
So, here's your task, scan all the logs
for error.
Context fork. So, you're forking the
agent into a like a separate thread
where
whatever the agent does and thinks and
adds tokens to does not come back and
pollute the main
uh
the main context.
Now,
you see here what happens, then you take
this
summation, and then you add that
summation without all the other stuff
into the overriding context. Now, this
last little block is kind of
interesting, I think. Because
you can check your token count,
and you can determine how big the token
count is.
And
if you can set some limit and you know,
if if you have more than 150,000 tokens,
then what you want to do is you can run
a compact. So, Anthropic and Claude have
these compaction algorithms
that take this giant context and and
compact it in some way, shape, or form.
Not quite sure how the implementation is
of that, but there is compaction. Now, a
little side effect a little side channel
I've been walking around when you walk
outside, you see see these guys handing
out these books.
Okay? Anybody see these guys handing out
these but take them. This is this is
actually a pretty good little book. In
fact, I was looking at it last night and
one of the things it had in it was this
is by this guy Sam
Sam Bagwell. I have no connection I
didn't even know Sam, but it there's a
online page 32.
It says
uh his company provides custom logic for
compression of context. So, he's got an
and you can write your own. He's got a
he's got he you can extend his base
class and have your own
compression of your data, whatever you
think is important. So, I think that's
kind of an interesting spin on this
whole thing.
Okay.
Cloud code for
uh uh continuous integration
uh anti-pattern
Always have interactive modes in a
pipeline. Well, no no no cuz interactive
modes mean uh
Cloud will stop and ask you, "You want
to do this? You want to do that? Can I
have permission for that?" So, there are
ways to set it up so that it'll just run
straight through, okay?
The other
uh
the other tip that I'll give you here
is there's something called
the uh
the batch. So, you can take your
prompts, you can take your work, and you
can put them in a batch and for 50%
fewer token cost you will get the result
they promise in at at least 24 hours.
So, if you're going to go take a nap,
you're going to go on vacation, you're
going to go out, take a a day off, run
your stuff in batch mode, and you're
going to have a a
less to pay.
Where am I here?
All right, I've only got a few few
minutes left, few seconds left, but I
want to conclude with this.
Remember, nothing is a mistake. There's
no win, there's no fail, there's no
exam,
only make. You do it and you make it and
you're going to succeed. If you want to
reach out to me, reach out to me uh coil
at Berkeley, look at my websites. I got
a website co-supreme AI. I'm a big jazz
fan and I named this website after John
Coltrane, Love Supreme, if you know that
song, great. Anyway, that's my story and
I'm sticking to it and I'm about to zero
time. Okay,
&gt;&gt; [applause]
&gt;&gt; thank you.
