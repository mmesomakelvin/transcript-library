Today I'm joined by Taranjit and Desh
the founders of MM0. They just announced
a 24 million raise to build the memory
layer for AI. Congrat.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for having us.
&gt;&gt; All right. Tell us what is Mezero today.
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank you for having us.
Mezero is building memory layer for AI
agents. Right now everybody is trying to
create an AI agent and all of them are
using LLM. But there's a fundamental
issue. LLMs are stateless. They don't
remember things like human remembers. So
we are trying to fix that for every
agent and every AI app that anybody is
creating out there.
&gt;&gt; It means that every time someone uh does
a prompt then the agent start from
scratch and don't memor don't remember
whatever happened before.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What's the current state of the
business?
&gt;&gt; The current state of the business is
doing well. We are the most adopted
solution in the market in terms of
traction. We recently crossed 14 million
Python package downloads, 41,000 GitHub
stars.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're open source, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we are open source and we are used
by thousand of companies across. We not
only power memory for companies, we also
provide memory for major agentic
frameworks like AWS, agents SDK, crewi,
flow wise, etc. And recently we
announced our $24 million funding round.
&gt;&gt; And what are the main benefits here? Of
of course agents get that memory but
what is the benefit for them?
&gt;&gt; Uh the main benefit for anyone who is
using a solution like me zero in their
AI agent is like their agent improves uh
over time. It's like let's say if I'm
building a uh trip planner agent and I'm
like whenever I'm going to New York I
want to stay in Airbnbs the agent will
remember this preference and the next
time whenever I'm automatically booking
a trip to New York it will just surface
it. So that's the first benefit wherein
like the new AI apps and agents that are
coming they know you in the best
possible way and then apart from that
for developers we also help them save
cost because you optimize the prompt and
you also help them save latency.
&gt;&gt; So how how do you save cost? That's
interesting because you have more data.
&gt;&gt; No. So the most naive way wherein like
anybody who wants to have some sort of
memory layer is by passing everything
into the context window.
&gt;&gt; When you pass everything into the
context window, you are you know sending
more tokens. So more cost and more
latency. We on the other hand will
optimize for the right and the most
accurate information. That's how we save
cost into.
&gt;&gt; So instead of like talking everything
that happened and then copy pasting that
in the prompt, you can be more smart
about what you share.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yep.
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Tell us more about how you
started like where are you from guys?
&gt;&gt; I'll go first. You know I'm from India.
I moved to US last year and uh my
journey involves me taking seven
attempts in starting a company. M
&gt;&gt; I took the first attempt in 2012. Uh
this is the seventh attempt in me
starting a company and [laughter]
I got lucky that I got Disha as a
co-founder and CTO in this journey along
and it's
&gt;&gt; we met actually uh during our undergrad.
Uh we are undergrad friends. We know
each other since like 2012. So been 13
years. We did a lot of projects like
during our undergrad uh a lot of side
projects and always wanted to like start
something of our own. TJ was doing a lot
of things in India. I was here working
at Tesla Autopilot uh where I was
leading the AI platform team. Um and
then he was shifting here and we were
like let's build something together and
that's how like this whole story came
together
&gt;&gt; and then you join forces and apply to
IC.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I remember when you applied you
actually joined us with another idea not
me zero right what happened? Can you
tell us a little more of that story? So
we got into IC in summer 24 batch and we
were interviewing with you around March
and April of 2024. At that time we were
going through a shift from not just
focusing on rag and focusing more on
solving the statelessness problem of LMS
when we were applying the company name
and the product name was still embed
chain but we were behind the whole
trinkering with the memory idea. Uh the
genesis of this idea is from a app that
Disha and I built in December 23. It was
called Sudguru AI. Sadguru is a very
famous Indian yogi.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Uh that app went viral in India and one
of the common feedback from that
application was that this app is cool
but it is kind of dumb because it
doesn't remember anything about my
meditative journey. So that's when we
started thinking like why is this
happening and we realized that it's
because LLMs are stateless. Rag is one
way to give context about a knowledge
base. But then Disha and I kept thinking
about it and we were like this is
something deeper than that and that's
how we started tinkering with like early
versions of mem chain and we remember uh
when both of us met you for the first
time at YC retreat
&gt;&gt; and we were like talking about all the
algorithms that we have developed and
you were like you know why haven't you
launched yet and within like 36 hours we
ended up launching from embed chain to
me zero and since then the journey has
been really great.
&gt;&gt; That's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah,
like the the traction the open source
traction has been very very impressive.
People started adopting right away,
right? It's it's so uh so funny to see
that the idea came from the side project
that was a consumer app that took off
pretty much. That's that's excellent.
&gt;&gt; Let's go back to the product. So, how
does that work exactly like the inside
of the product? I'm a developer. I
implement you in my product. How is that
going to work?
&gt;&gt; I mean, I'll just cover from like a high
level perspective. So, the product is
composed of two primitives. one is like
adding a adding a memory and the other
one is like searching a memory and these
primitives reflect in our APIs. Uh so we
make it very easy for a developer to
give us any you know sort of data they
feel is important on a user level. We
try our best to understand what is
important from that and then we build a
state on top of it. So let's say if you
are like building like a person a
companion you'll give give us your chat
responses. We'll try to extract
meaningful information from it and we'll
try to build a state on top of it.
Building a state is important because
that helps us in understanding how the
evolution is happening and then whenever
like the user is coming let's say the
user is trying to you know start a new
conversation we'll give you the most
important conf you know information out
there behind the uh hood we go through
like a technical process which dish
&gt;&gt; yeah so um our algorithm is actually
like a hybrid data store architecture
that we have implemented where we are
actually uh whenever some unstructured
information that comes into we basically
try to like classify that into like a
key value pair depending on what kind of
information it is or as a semantic chunk
or as like a graph memory which we call
basically where you are trying to
basically create like relations between
like different facts that you're
collecting so that later whenever
developer is actually requesting like
hey uh give me relevant information that
you know about me we go and like pull
information from all these three sources
and we do it effectively and do it in
real time so that helps you basically
have like a really low uh latency in
terms of retrieval and still have like
high accuracy. And by doing all of this,
you're also like able to like save cost
and latency because, you know, instead
of putting everything into the context
window, which is going to be expensive
and uh like slow, so it just uh solves
the problem for them. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; To be able to create all of that
representation of the kind of the memory
of the end user, you need to understand
the the actual application. Do you know
you need to understand what's the actual
purpose of the application? That's the
part which is like somewhat hard but
it's also easy where like we put in like
a lot of effort to understand what the
developer is building. So during
onboarding of the product we try to
understand like what are you trying to
build and memory is an expectation
problem. So like for you uh your memory
might be different for me my memories
might be different even for the same
task right. So we try our best both on
the open source on the on the cloud
version that you can customize anything
that's possible. So you can come down
and you can be like hey I don't want
like this kind of memories to be
captured I want this and all of this is
in plain language plain like natur
&gt;&gt; it's going to be interpreted by anm
&gt;&gt; yeah and then we like try to form rules
on top of it and then we rerun the
pipeline we we update all the memories
for you
&gt;&gt; do you have any uh good examples of use
cases like things that people have done
with the product
&gt;&gt; when we talk about memory I think like
memory should be a default primitive
whenever you're building an AI
application a couple of highle use cases
that we have seen across uh people try
to use some sort of memory solution for
efficiently managing their context
encoding agents. People try to use some
sort of memory solution when they are
building a personal companion. People
try to use you know memory solutions in
education wherein they want to remember
the learning trajectory. In healthcare
wherein they want to remember everything
about the patient and the medicine in
finance they want to remember the entire
trajectory. So it's like wherever you're
building you know like an LLM based
application
&gt;&gt; and you want it to get better over time
&gt;&gt; you should need memory and you should
use M0.
&gt;&gt; Yeah we have also like started seeing
this very interesting pattern now where
instead of capturing memories about
humans people are actually now building
more and more agents so they want
memories about the agent so they want to
capture more and more of that as well.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Excellent. Is there sometime an issue
when memories become stale kind of like
is there any kind of decay of the
memories and then you want to use them
differently?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So that's a very good question
actually. So we have been seeing this
pattern from our users where different
developers actually ask for like
different kind of DK. Uh sometimes like
customers are like hey I want like a
hard DK where after 6 months I don't
care about any memory. Sometimes
developers ask for exponential DK where
they care more about the recent stuff
but they want to forget as memories get
super old. And sometimes we have also
seen developers ask about like certain
things depending on their application.
Let's say someone is building like a
travel planner agent. Uh things that are
related to travel preferences always
matter no matter how old they are. So
but they still want to like forget other
stuff which are probably not that
relevant. So we are seeing these
interesting patterns and we have like
implementations of each of these DK
mechanisms.
&gt;&gt; Is that same thing like they are going
to describe what they want like in plain
language. It is kind of but there are
certain other knobs that you can also
tune basically to enable that.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Excellent. Uh let's take a a step
back quickly. OpenAI recently launched
this memory layer for OpenAI like other
labs are building the same of course
like are you still a relevant in that
world like what does it mean for you?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's a good thing for us
wherein like all the big labs are
launching memory and the memory is
available in their consumer app
offerings and it's a matter of time that
it becomes available as an API for
developers. uh the fact that it's good
for us is because they're educating the
market that you need memory as a default
primitive in any AI application but for
us it's good because developers are
using multiple LLMs whenever they're
building an AI application right and
memory is not just read only memory is
write only also so in that case as in
you know best engineering practice and
even like as a first principal thinking
you would not want to tie your memory to
any you know model provider out there
for model provider it memory is the next
mode because models are becoming having
a commodity but for a developer because
they are using multiple LLMs it should
be decoupled
&gt;&gt; they want to own the memory and not
&gt;&gt; like always have the option to change uh
model
&gt;&gt; okay that makes complete sense u and uh
and that not you mentioned that you work
with other kind of frameworks other
partners like AWS like how does that
work like uh people using these
frameworks have you out of the box
&gt;&gt; yeah so like uh we not only serve the
customers we also provide memory to
agentic framework frameworks
&gt;&gt; like we are the exclusive memory
provider in the a AWS agent SDK called
strands and then we power memory for all
the other major agentic frameworks like
crewi flow wise the idea is that memory
is something which should be neutral to
anything it should be neutral to
framework it should be neutral to your
model provider it should be neutral to
llm so that's how we gave it like as a
very simple tool call in any of the
agent frameworks out there and
developers who are using multiple
frameworks even can have their memory in
a central fashion and like keep it like
decoupled from anything out there.
&gt;&gt; You recently announced your like kind of
big fundraising like 24 million from
basis set and p 15 and others like
&gt;&gt; uh what did they see in you like what
convinced them to invest?
&gt;&gt; First of all it's a you know it's a 24
million seed plus series round. Our seed
was done by led by Kindred. CDA was led
by Basiset. Uh Basiset participated in
our seed round and we have known like
LAN uh very well for over a year and uh
we really like the partnership so far
and uh when we decided to raise uh they
quickly got back to us with like the
fact that they wanted to double down on
us and we you know were fortunate enough
to raise from them peak 15, Kindred,
Vice and a lot of other angels as like
great angels as well. That's so they saw
like the traction pretty much they were
already insiders. They knew things were
working. Yeah. And wanted to go down.
&gt;&gt; What are you going to do with all this
money?
&gt;&gt; I mean we want to build the best
possible memory product on the planet.
Uh we are going to use this fund to hire
the best possible team so that we can
build the best possible product. Nothing
else.
&gt;&gt; How big is the team today?
&gt;&gt; Uh so we are like now 10 people uh split
across India and SF office.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. And so what role are you hiring
for?
&gt;&gt; So we are hiring across. We are hiring
for you know applied we are hiring for
full stack. We are hiring for forward
deployed. We are hiring for uh GTM
engineer. Dhraj can give like a one
minute pitch also. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; No I think across the across the uh
engineering uh organization basically we
are trying to double down and like ship
as fast as possible and that's why like
full stack forward deployed applied AI
research engineer um front end back end
&gt;&gt; both here and in India
&gt;&gt; both. Yes that's correct.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. And like whatever work we
are doing I think like on engineering
side it's like one of the most
challenging work out there. You have to
build like a low latency infra product
&gt;&gt; and you're solving an expectation
problem. So you have to have to cater to
every user and you have to make sure
that memories work well reliably at
scale.
&gt;&gt; Excellent. And what do you see next
happening in that world of memory for
AI? Like what would be your vision like
a year two years from now? We recently
came up with this uh you know three
sentences uh while brainstorming. We
call it like make it work, make it
neutral and make it portable. Right now
we are in the first two phases wherein
like memory works but memory should work
very well across any domain out there.
So we have to keep pushing the frontiers
of that and we want to keep it neutral.
It should not be tied to anything out
there. But the broader theme that we see
maybe which happens in like 5 to 10
years from now is like we are going
through a technological shift. So far we
as humans have been interacting with any
technology using swipe, scroll and
click. But that's going to change. It's
going to be a lot of agentic interfaces.
For the first time you and I can chat
with any app or can talk with any app
and the app can talk back to you. So we
you everyone is accumulating rich
personal data and that and history you
know has shown us multiple times that
user expectation always move towards
less friction. So 5 years down the line
when you are having like a hundreds of
AI apps in your life day on a day-to-day
basis and you would have like given
every app some custom instruction about
how it should be and you're trying to
and you're trying the 101 app and you're
like why doesn't this app just get me? M
&gt;&gt; so that's the future whereable like you
want
&gt;&gt; like any any person any consumer any
like you me like we want all of the
agents we work with to know us and to
share that information.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. So that's the future that
we're excited towards. We don't know
when will that happen but we believe
that there is a high chance
&gt;&gt; it is going to happen and wherever that
happens we want to build the
infrastructure that caters to the
developers for today's needs and for
tomorrow's expectations. Excellent.
Before to conclude uh let's go back
quickly on your journey as uh as
founders like is there anything you wish
you could tell you when you were
starting?
&gt;&gt; I think one thing that I have realized
for my journey is like focus is very
critical and it goes back to like
fundamentals of computer science also.
So I was thinking recently that like
okay uh you whenever doing a startup you
want to make sure you apply DFS rather
than applying BFS so that you stay
focused when you're actually like
working on the startup. So if you're if
you have multiple ideas in the age of AI
you have so many ideas always stay
focused focus on one thing go deep build
it talk to customers
&gt;&gt; well in your case like you kind of like
defocused yourself by building that
consumer app and it worked. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Yeah. It was blessing in
disguise for us.
&gt;&gt; Blessing for disguise. Yeah. like not
what you would recommend for others.
Have
&gt;&gt; I think for for me I think I I mean it
sounds very philosophical but it's like
something that I've you know tested
multiple times in your life. I think
everything is possible. You just have to
believe in it and you just have to make
it work.
&gt;&gt; If you're like hellbent like I've been
trying to do my own company since like
2012.
&gt;&gt; Uh it took me like 13 14 years. I think
if I would have just thought harder and
I would have just had like more
conviction in myself, I would have just
made it I might have made it worked
earlier. So I would say like believe in
yourself.
&gt;&gt; It would not have taken like 13 years
but like maybe
&gt;&gt; yeah I mean like yeah I think like
believe in yourself is like very simple
but powerful statement.
&gt;&gt; That's great advice. [laughter]
Uh thank you so much for joining us
today. It was great to have you. Thank
you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having us. Thank you.
