What's up engineers? Andy Devdan here.
We've got a couple massive releases to
cover. Of course, there is the brand new
Claude Opus 4.6. It's a fantastic model.
What else is there to say? It's beating
all the benchmarks. You've already
heard, you've already seen this. This is
not what I want to focus on here. The
real big idea I want to cover with you
today is multi- aent orchestration. The
game on the field is changing. It's no
longer about what the models allow us to
do. As of Sonnet 4.5, these models can
do much more than you and I give them
credit for. Than you and I really know
how to unlock. The true constraint of
agentic engineering now is twofold. It's
the tools we have available and it's you
and I. It is our capabilities. It's our
ability to prompt engineer and context
engineer the outcomes we're looking for
and build them into reusable systems to
build them into powerful agentic layers
that you and I can wield. The true
limitation is you and I. So let's take
another stab at improving what we can
do. Frontends, backends, scripts. It's
too simple for these models. So what I
have here is eight unique applications
that I had claude opus 4.6 create. I
touched none of these by the way. These
are all oneshotted. I like to use E2B.
Use whatever you want. So Asian
sandboxes very powerful. But once again,
this is not exactly what I want to focus
on here. We're going to use Asian
sandboxes as a playground to understand
and to really dive into two key big
ideas. Multi- aent orchestration, multi-
aent observability. Once you put these
two pieces together, you can do much
more with your powerful cloud code opus
4.6 agent.
So, first things first, we're going to
crack open the terminal. If we create a
new cloud code instance on our multi-
aent observability, you'll see that we
have a new agent joining the session and
we have that session start hook
captured. We have a rocket and we've
officially kicked off a new session. But
before we touch our new multi- aent
orchestration capabilities, we need to
boot up cloud code in a different way.
Close this. And you'll see we got that
session end event captured here. And
instead of opening this up in a classic
terminal, we're going to use T-Mox. And
so this is going to give us some
powerful capabilities. You'll see in a
second. The next thing we're going to do
is I just want to make this super clear.
I'm going to type which and then clio.
So you can see this exact command that
I'm running. We're going to export the
new cloud code experimental agent teams
feature. Setting that to one. We're
enabling that feature. So now we're
running cloud code inside of a team
session. You can see we kicked off a
brand new agent. And this is where
things get interesting. If I type ls,
these are the agent sandbox directories
that you saw here. We're going to have
our agents investigate and break down
how we can set up these applications.
So, this going to be our first agent
team. Build a new agent team for each
codebase in this directory. Have an
agent summarize and how to set it up.
What you're going to see here is really
extraordinary. You can see all of our
events getting captured. Observability
is really important for knowing what you
can really do with your tool. You can
see here we're going to start streaming
in all of our agent events. Make sure
that this is stuck to the bottom here.
The first thing our agent does is it
creates a task list. We covered this in
our previous video. What happens next is
extraordinary. So we're in T-Mux and so
T-Mux has PES. Our agent is now opening
up brand new PES for each sub agent that
it wants to run. All right. So I'm going
to go full screen here so we can really
take a look at this. And I'm going to
downsize this a little bit so we can see
all eight agents that we kicked off
here. Okay. So on the left, our primary
agent set up the task list, created a
team, and then it assigned a task to
each member of the team. And you can see
our status lines giving us the agent.
Looks like we have haiku agents. You can
see our context window, and our agents
are going to figure out how to run and
summarize each codebase, right? And so
if we scroll back here in our agent
observability, you can see a lot of work
happening. Our haiku agents are running
all the tools they need to accomplish
the work. And we can dial into an
individual agent here. If we click this,
you can see this is all the tool calls
for one of our agents. Looks like this
is our primary agent here, right? Open
4.6. You know, you can see here a lot of
work is happening here guys, right?60
tool calls within just a minute time
span. Okay, we are scaling our compute
to scaler impact. All right, if we hop
back over here, you can see all the
pains are gone. Now, what happened? All
of our agents finished, right? They
finished their work. So, we can go ahead
and get out of full screen mode. And
it's just our primary agent running now.
Uh we can go ahead and get rid of their
swim lane here. And this is a really
powerful capability of multi- aent
orchestration. You want to spin up
specialized agents that do one thing
extraordinarily well, right? They focus
on one task and then they finish. So our
primary agent now is just putting
together a summary of the work done by
the eight agents. And you know, take a
look at the context window here. We've
only used 31%. So that means that all of
our other agents, they explored eight
different code bases. And and to be
super clear here, guys, um these are not
just frontends. These are full stack
applications. Okay? Every single one of
these are fullstack applications. We can
fully interact with these and you know
these are fully built out. They were
oneshotted by Opus. Very powerful
capabilities here. And none of this
matters if you can't first trigger these
features and prompt your primary agent
to control these powerful workflows. And
if you have no idea what's going on
underneath the hood, right? This is
where vibe coders fall apart. They don't
actually know what's going on. And so
the engineers, the builders, and even
the vibe coders that know what's going
on underneath the hood can do so much
more. This whole idea that uh engineers
are going to be replaced by this
technology to me is absurd. And it's
because engineers are the best
positioned to use agentic technology. So
you can see here that um if I hit
controlB and left bracket, I'm in scroll
mode. Now, the annoying thing about
T-Max is that it does change the
controls a little bit. I'm in control
mode and if I just scroll up, you can
see we have summaries for every single
agent sandbox application that's stored
in my local directory. Okay, so you can
see here nice summary of all eight and
the primary agent knows how to spin them
up. Let's push our multi- aent
capabilities further.
Here's what we're going to do now. So,
I'm going to get out of this mode. I'm
just going to hit escape. And we're back
in our primary window here. Let's go
ahead and actually spin up new agent
sandbox instances with each one of these
applications. All right. And we'll do it
in two teams. We'll have a team of four
uh mount the first four applications.
Right. Because we have eight unique
applications here. If we run ls um and
then I'll have a team of four doing the
last set of applications. Okay. Um let's
prompt engineer this properly. All
right. We're going to start with the
most important piece. Build a new agent
team. So we're triggering. Right. These
are information dense keywords that tell
the agent we want a specific set of
tools to execute. All right. And then
I'll say using agent sandboxes. So this
is my agent sandbox skill and backslash
command. This is a special skill that I
have to do wacky stuff like this. Use
the back slashreboot and mount 1 through
4 in their own agent sandbox. Be sure to
set up every agent. So part of my
workflow when I'm doing rapid
prototyping, what I like to do is just
build it all in an agent sandbox like
E2B as you saw here, right? This is an
agent sandbox. And then what I'll do is
if I like one of the versions, I'll copy
it down locally. And I have prompts for
that, of course. So what we're going to
do now is basically rehost these
applications with a specialized agent
team. So we'll fire this off. And you
can see here right away our
observability system picked up on that
new user prompt submit event. And now
things are going to get awesome again.
Our agent is going to first run the
agent sandbox skill and it's going to
run the back slashcomand skill so that
it understands what back slash reboot
does. And then it's going to actually
kick off the reboot for every one of
these directories. And so our agent has
figured out all of our tooling. It ran
our agent sandbox skill. It ran our
backslash command skill. And now it's
creating that task list again. And so
the task list is the centralized hub.
This is where everything gets kicked off
from. There we go. Okay. So very cool.
Now we're kicking off our agent team.
You can see we have that new pane. So we
have our primary agent kicking off the
first agent. And this agent is then
going to run that skill. So every single
agent has its own context window, right?
So they all need to run the skill. They
all need to run the setup commands. You
can see it's running through the E2B
setup process. And these are all Opus
4.6 agents. But you can see here all of
our agents are getting kicked off again.
And I'll just go ahead and and you know
downsize this a little bit and go full
screen here so we can get a good picture
of what's going on. Right. All four Opus
agents are running in parallel. They're
each going to reboot the application.
You know what we saw here in the
beginning? Basically, we're going to
recreate these agent sandbox instances
with this new multi- aent orchestration
tool. And so, if we hop back to our
agent observability system once again,
you can see tons and tons of work
happening. Right? If we dial into one of
these swim lanes, we can get a better
understanding of the tools and the
impact that every agent is creating. And
you know really importantly here if we
search for our brand new tools you can
see we have these new task list tools uh
we should see some if we scroll up here
you'll see right we have task update and
we have task right so this is kicking
off the generalized agent and you can
see here this is the exact command that
was run to kick off a sub agent sub
agent that is executing right here and
the great part about running this in
T-Max is of course the panes we can
continue to just zoom out a little bit
so you can get a better view Here, every
one of our agents has their own context
window, their own model, their own
session ID, and you can see they all
have their own unique name here as well,
right? SBX agent, sandbox agent 1 2 3
and four, right? So, this is fantastic.
So, I'm focused in this individual
window here inside of T-Mox, we need to
hit controlB and then left to change our
cursor position. What I want to do here
is get the the names of the other
sandboxes that we didn't kick off. So,
I'm just going to ask the primary agent
because it's actually not doing anything
right now. The primary agent is sitting
waiting for events to come back. List
sandbox directories we didn't kick off.
And you can see here sandbox agent
number four has completed its setup.
It's pinged a command back to our
primary orchestrator agent. So what I'm
going to do here is while this is
running, I'm going to go ahead and open
up a new terminal and kick these off.
Let's see if I got a clean paste out of
that. We're not going to kick this off
in our flat window, right? We need T-Mox
to get that visualization to get those
multiple panes. So I'm going to run
T-Mox once again. Then I'll boot up
Cloud Code and then I'll effectively run
that exact same prompt. Then what I want
to do is get the names of those agents
that did not run. So I'll copy this. And
I'm doing a little bit of correction
here on another screen. I'm having
trouble copying this. And so I'm just
going to ask my agent to do this for me.
Uh, copy the four sandbox directories to
my clipboard. Should do a PB copy. There
we go. And then I'll just paste this. So
only post these four. There we go. And
I'll kick that off. Now, we're going to
get the remaining sandboxes kicked up.
And I'm sure you may have noticed this,
but if I go into scroll mode here and
scroll to the top, I have run out of my
API usage for today on my Cloud Max
plan. So, I am using API billing and uh
yeah, this is going to burn a hole in my
wallet. Drop a like, drop a comment, uh
so that the YouTube algorithm can can
pay for some of this API usage. But I'll
hit escape and I'll go ahead and let
this second agent start kicking off this
workflow. And so, we're going to see the
same thing. And if we look at our agent
observability, we can see everything. We
can understand everything that our
agents are doing top to bottom. And if
we go ahead and look over here, you can
see that we have one more agent
finishing up its work. Right? Sandbox
agent number two is the last one still
in progress. So this is a very powerful
feature. We can now observe our agents
in a more improved way just with T-Mox,
just by seeing these new PES open up as
our primary orchestrator agent starts to
set up and scale up this work. Then
whenever we need to, we can just scale
up and create a brand new team. So
here's that second team of agents doing
a whole different set of work in a brand
new window. All right, so you can see
that same process. We go full screen. Uh
minimize this a little bit so we can get
a better view. We have two teams of
agents working and we have an
observability system to trace the whole
thing. And so whenever we want to, we
can just come in here. It's got all four
agents running. It's going to mount
these applications. We're going to
create a new E2B agent sandbox, upload
the app codebase, install, get
everything set up as if it's a brand new
environment. So, we're combining several
really, really powerful ideas here that
we've been talking about on the channel
week after week. We have multi- aent
observability so we know what's going
on, so we know how to improve and
understand our systems. We have spaces
to place our agents so that they can do
whatever they need to to accomplish
their work without jeopardizing our
local machine. And then of course we
have the new multi- aent orchestration
capabilities coming out of claw code on
top of a brand new ultra powerful model
that can run long duration tasks. All
right. So we're talking about long
threads. We're talking about big threads
and we're handing off more and more work
to our agents. That is the theme here.
How can you prompt engineer and how can
you context engineer with great powerful
models to get more engineering work done
than ever with confidence. All right. We
want to be building systems of trust
with our agents. Now, scaling up the
model is always going to help with this,
but this is not something we're really
in control of. Whenever the new model
ships, whatever it costs, we are just
subjects to that. But what we can
control is the great tooling we use
alongside these three powerful
capabilities. And so, that's one of the
big ideas I wanted to share with you
here today. Multi-agent orchestration,
multi- aent observability, so you can
dial in to anything your agents are
doing. And then of course we have agent
sandboxes, a secure location to place
whatever you want to have your agents do
at scale. All right. And so we have two
teams of four. To be clear, the agents
are running on my device, but the work
they're doing is operating off the
device. They're using their local agent
capabilities, their local skills, and
then they are creating and operating
inside their own agent sandboxes. Okay.
So our first team is all set up. And if
we go into scroll mode here, Ctrl +B
left bracket, and we do some scrolling,
we should be able to see everything set
up live. So, let's go ahead and open
these up. I'll take these existing
windows, these existing sandboxes. I'll
just move them up onto my monitor here.
And then we should see them open up in
this browser window here. We'll take a
look at the the brand new tools that
allow and enable these workflows in just
a second. Let's go ahead and just get
these opened up so we can see how our
agents have done. I'll say open in
Chrome. You can see these sandboxes are
going to be alive for 12 hours. All
right. And it looks like they did open
up in this other window. Super annoying.
That's fine. I will copy these four
newest ones. Drag them in. Here we go.
So, here's our agentic support. It looks
like we're missing some data here. And
looks like we're missing data here.
Let's see if we got our gallery. Nice.
Okay. So, we did get some nice
information there. And we have our data
here. All right. So, very cool. And so,
we can continue to prompt to resolve
these issues. I'm going to go ahead and
just give this a shot. And I'll say data
is missing from this. And let's go ahead
and go here as well. Basically, our
sandboxes were rebooted, but it didn't
reboot with the exact same data or with
any data for those two applications. So,
we're going to go ahead and have these
agents do this work. And what I'll do
here is I'm going to stop this cuz the
primary agent started working, right?
You saw that the primary agent is trying
to take over. I'll say spin up a new
agent team to do this work for you. Give
them all the context they need. skills
sandbox back/command. And so I'm just
being super verbose there with my prompt
engineering with that agent. You can see
here our second team finished. So let's
see how this team did. Yeah, open all
four URLs in Chrome. Okay, so we'll kick
these off. All right, so we have these
opened up. Let's go ahead and get these
drag and dropped over here. Okay, we
have our mission briefings dashboard. We
have our portfolio application, so we
can track our forecast for our
portfolio. We have a recipe app and we
have a ad dashboard to see how our ads
are performing. Nice. So we got all the
data for these. So all of these four
worked. Love to see that. And the two
issues we had with these code bases are
getting resolved here with our two agent
agent team. So this is an iterative
process as well. We're going to want to
be firing off ad hoc agent teams to
perform specific sets of work. In our
previous video where we talked about the
task list feature, let me go ahead and
see if I have that diagram pulled up
here. Yeah. So in our previous video we
talked about the cloud code task system
where you prompt your primary agent and
your primary agent creates a task list
that multiple agents basically an agent
team operates on. This is a very
powerful feature that is taken to the
next step with the multi- aent
orchestration feature that you can now
tap into. All right, but the idea here
is really really important as you're
building out real features as you're
scaling up the work you can do with your
agents. It's not just about a single
agent or even a couple agents or even
parallel agents. You want to be building
teams that communicate together that are
all driven toward accomplishing one
specific goal, right? Think about
building out a feature. That's way too
much work, especially as you enter real
legitimate production code bases.
Building out a full feature requires
organization. It requires communication,
right? And so this new agent
orchestration feature allows us to
really tap into that brand new system,
that way of thinking. All right? And and
this is what this feature looks like end
to end. We're going to create a team.
We're going to uh create tasks. We're
spawn agents. They all work in parallel
and then they shut down and then we
delete the team. And we'll look at the
tools here in just a second. But a
really important aspect of this is that
when the work is done, you want to
delete the agents. This forces a good
pattern of context engineering where you
reset the context and start over. So you
can see here's the agent shutdown
process happening from our primary
agent. These are shutting down. The
tasks are gone. The pains are now gone.
And so apparently this has fixed the
issue. You can see here DB was intact.
We restarted. Uh both processes were
down. So we should be good on these two
uh applications. Let's refresh. Still
not good there. That's too bad. And
let's refresh here. It looks like this
one did load its data here. Let me see
if that actually worked. Loading pull
requests. And still nothing here. All
right. So we have issues here. I don't
really care about these. You get the
point here, right? We got six out of
eight sandbox environments spun up in
brand new systems. And you know, just to
be super clear and transparent. Here are
the new environments and the new URLs.
Here are the old ones. I just want to
show that I have these and that these
are actually different URLs. All right,
so these are all unique Asian sandboxes.
And we can be even clear about this. I
have a bunch of these running right now.
If I go to a terminal here and I say um
I pass in this skill, we should spin up
a new agent for this. We always want to
be operating on fresh instances. We
don't need T-Max for this. This is going
to be a single cloud code instance. And
I just want to show you all the current
running agent sandboxes. So I'll kick
this off. I'll fire off my agent sandbox
skill. And I'll just say list all
running sandboxes. And so we should see
I don't know some 20 or 30 sandboxes
here. You can see it's validating my ETB
key. And then um let's go ahead and see.
There we go. Working through some
issues. It of course has a sandbox list.
You can see we have 24 sandboxes. Let's
go ahead and get that list just to make
it super clear here how much compute
we're running in parallel. There we go.
Looks like that was the command. It's
getting the information for each sandbox
environment. I'll link a previous video
where we talked about how you can set
this up and how this really works in the
description for you if you're
interested. I think agent sandboxes are
and will be a big big big trend as we
scale up what our agents can do on our
behalf. You're seeing this with the
whole Mac Mini craze. As you can see in
the background, um I have a Mac Mini.
I've had this thing for a while and was,
you know, a decent amount ahead of that
trend, having my agents run in its own
dedicated environment. As you can
imagine, I have multiple sandbox
environments. One like E2B operating
purely in the cloud. And then for more
personal workflow where, you know,
privacy is important. You can have
agents run of course on your own local
devices like everyone is doing with
Maltbot or Cloudbot or whatever it's
called now. But you can see here, you
know, I have 24 agent sandboxes running.
And you know, you can see I have
duplicates of a lot of these things that
we've been looking at here, right? So I
have multiple versions of this. Just
wanted to make this super clear. I have
a skill. I have an agent that operates
and can manage all of these agent
sandboxes at scale. This is going to be
really important moving forward when
you're scaling your compute to scale
your impact, which is the big theme of
everything we're looking at right now.
All right. Here we looked at how to spin
up teams of agents. Okay. And it all
comes back to things we talk about on
the channel all the time. all these
fantastic new tools coming out of the
cloud code team, all these new
capabilities. There is a lot of
engineering work they put into this. You
know, big shout out to the cloud code
team. But I do want to say that
underneath all of it is a concept we
always discuss. It's the core for
context model prompt tools. Everything
boils down to that. All right,
everything is the core four. Okay, and
just quickly, you know, we saw all of
this work happen. We saw our multi- aent
system track all of this. And you can
see all these new task tools. Team
delete, team create. We have these new
task tools. Task create, task get. So
what are all the new available tools?
Let's go and take a look at this. We
have kind of three categories of tools
that this, you know, new multi- aent
orchestration system gives us. Team
management, task management, and
communications. Team create, task, team
delete. Task has been around for a long
time. This is how you kick off an agent
in parallel. But then we have all the
new task management tools, right? task
create, task list, task get, task
update. But the most important one of
all probably is this send message. This
is how the agents were communicating and
after they communicate, after they do
all the work as we described here in
this workflow, right? This is kind of
the multi- aent orchestration workflow
built out with this new tool. It's it's
this, right? Create the team, create the
tasks, spawn the agents, work in
parallel, shut them all down, delete the
team. This is the full workflow of the
brand new Claw multi- aent capabilities.
So with every new capability, with every
new feature coming out of cloud code,
coming out of all these agentic coding
tools, with every new release of the new
model, the question is always the same
for you and I, the engineer with our
boots on the ground working with the
technology every single day. How can we
understand the capabilities available to
us to accelerate our engineering work?
models will improve, tools will change,
and that means that you and I will
always be the limitation. It's about
what you and I can do. So, with every
feature release, make sure you're
digging in. Make sure you're
understanding what's available to you so
that you know what you can do. Every
engineer is limited by their tools and
their knowledge of their tool. So,
that's why multi- aent observability is
super key. Throughout any point in this
workflow, we can jump in here and we can
investigate and see the communication,
see the tasks between our agents that we
kicked off. We can see all the events.
I'm going to leave my multi- aent
observability updated to support all
these new tools. Link in the description
for you. And I'll also link a previous
video and my agent sandbox skill for you
to play with. Again, link in the
description for you. If you're
interested in taking your agentic coding
to the next level, check out tactical
agentic coding. This is my take on how
you can accelerate far past AI coding
and vibe coding with advanced agentic
engineering. So powerful your codebase
runs itself. We're seeing multi- aent
orchestration come out of the cloud code
team. We have had this documented and
covered inside of this course inside of
agentic horizon specifically. We have
had working versions of multi- aent
orchestration for months now. This is
all here. You know, a lot of the ideas
we talk about on the channel are taken
to the next level inside this course. If
you're interested, check this out. I
know a lot of engineers on the channel
have already checked out this course.
And you know, to be super clear, there
are thousands of engineers that have
taken this and that have gotten great
value out of this. So, I'll leave this
linked in the description if you're
interested as well. We're going to be
covering multi-agent orchestration a lot
as we move forward. It's going to be a
big trend because it allows us to do
what we always do on this channel. Scale
our compute to scale our impact. Thanks
so much for sticking around. You know
where to find me every single Monday.
Stay focused and keep building.
