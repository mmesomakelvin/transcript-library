If you want your agents to accomplish
loads of valuable work on your behalf,
they must be able to validate their
work. Why is validation so important?
Validation increases the trust we have
in our agents, and trust saves your most
valuable engineering resource, time. The
Cloudco team has recently shipped a ton
of features, but one in particular
stands above the rest. You can now run
hooks inside of your skills, sub aents,
and custom slash commands. This is a big
release most engineers have missed
because it means you can build
specialized selfidating agents
inside of this codebase. We're going to
kick off a new claw code instance and
we're going to run slash review finances
February. And then I'm going to look for
a specific February CSV file. Imagine
you're doing your monthly finances. This
is a system I'm building up to automate
some financial processing. I'm going to
copy the relative path of this and then
paste this here. This is going to kick
off an end toend pipeline of agents to
review finances, do a bunch of
formatting, generate a bunch of graphs,
and offer insights into this month's
finances. The important thing here isn't
the actual tool itself. Whenever there's
a new valuable feature, I like to build
against it and truly understand its
value proposition. So that's what we're
going to do here. This entire multi-
aent pipeline is going to run
specialized self validation every single
step of the way. You can see our primary
agent getting to work there. We're going
to let this run in the background and
we're going to circle back to this. What
I want to show you here is how to build
specialized self- validating agents step
by step. Let's start with the most
foundational and the most important, the
prompt.
In cloud code, prompts come in the form
of custom/comands.
We're going to go ahead and create some
new agentics. So, I'm going to open up
the commands directory, of course, hit
new, and we're going to build a CSVedit
markdown file. All right, so this is
going to be a new prompt that helps us
edit CSV files. All right, so we're
specializing this command to do one
thing extraordinarily well and therefore
we're specializing an agent to do just
that. I have a code snippet AGP. If
you've been following the channel, you
know what this does. This is an agentic
prompt template and I've made some new
modifications to it. So you can see here
at the top we have a huge payload of
front matter. And the front matter is
what's going to allow us to build our
specialized self- validation via hooks.
And you can see here we have support for
pre-tool use, posttool use, and stop.
This is what's supported in prompt, sub
aent, and skill hooks. Whenever I'm
creating a new prompt by hand, which I
still do by the way, you know, I have
meta agentics to help me quickly spin up
new prompts, sub aents, and other
skills. But I do like to write prompts
by hand. You know, there are some areas
where you just want to scale and go
crazy with your agents. When you're
talking about building that system that
builds the system, when you're talking
about working on your agents and really
understanding agentic patterns and
tools, you want to slow down and do it
by hand. So, let's go ahead and write
this prompt. I like to go just top to
bottom here for a CSV edit. This is
going to be a CSV editing tool. So,
we're going to make modifications and
report on CSV files. All right. So,
that's how we're specializing this. And
we will intake a CSV file and we'll also
intake a modification. So, this is the
user request. We'll just call this user
request for our tools here. This is just
CSV file writing. So, we do want to
specialize this agent. We want the
ability to search. We want read, write,
edit, and I think that's it. So let's go
and get rid of the rest of these context
fork. We don't want this to run in a
separate agent. We want this to run in
the current agent we have. We want this
to be model invocable. Keep this as
false. And now we have the juicy part,
the hook. So what do we want to self-
validate here? Whenever we're operating
on CSV files, we want our agent to be
able to validate that that CSV is in the
correct format. And so that means we
want the post tool use hook because this
will allow us to after a edit write and
I'm going to go ahead and add read here
as well. So after any one of these
commands run, we're going to run a
specific hook. We're going to run a
specific script. So I'm going to go
ahead and get rid of pre-tool use and
stop here. So this will just echo uh
post hook. Let's go ahead and update
this to be an actual script we have
inside of the codebase. The way I'm
organizing my code bases now in the age
of agents with these powerful self
validation techniques looks like this.
So in your classic.claude, you know,
commands agent skills blah blah blah.
Inside of hooks, I like to store a
validators directory. And you can see
here I have a whole bunch of validators.
We're going to use one in particular
here, CSV single validator. And so I
want my agent to kick this off. So I'll
type uvun. We need the path to this
specific project directory. So we're
going to use this claude variable here.
And then it's going to be claude. And
we're basically just path to this,
right? So I can go and get the quick
reference to this. Paste that. And now
we have exactly what we need. All right,
this is it. You know, you can see here
every one of my validators outputs its
own log file. So we're going to dig into
this in just a second. What we have here
now is an agent that after every post
tool use call, it's going to run this
script. And I have this once variable on
here. I actually wanted to just keep
self- validating. So I'm going to remove
this. And then we have our actual
prompt. I've written thousands of
prompts by now. And one of the most
important things you can do inside of
your code snippets, inside of your meta
prompts and your meta skills, your meta
agentics, is create reusable formats so
that you don't have to think about it
and so that your agents don't have to
think about your prompt format. You
know, you can see here anytime I run
this code snippet, I'm going to get the
exact same structure. And again, if
you've been with the channel, you
understand the structure very well. I'm
just going to go ahead and start working
on this. All I need here is these two
sections. So the purpose this is going
to of course make modifications or
report and we actually want or report on
CSV files and then we have a three-step
workflow here. Read the CSV file and
this is going to be our first arg and
then second is going to be make the
modification or report. And then lastly
we're going to report the results. All
right. And I have cursor tab turned off
here just so we can do this manually on
our own. We don't want to get lazy with
all these great tools. Of course you
want to be using agents for most of this
stuff. When you're learning something
new, when you're setting up a new
pattern, I think it's really good to
just go in by hand and on your agentic
layer, you want to be doing things by
hand. Move a little slower. Don't move
at the agentic speed that you probably
normally are. You want to take your time
with this stuff because, you know, if
you learn how to deploy the core 4
context model prompt tools properly, it
will make you a very, very high impact
engineer. So, here we go. We have a CSV
edit prompt that is going to selfidate.
We're using pandas here. And so we're
just doing pd. uh read and that's
basically it, right? So you can imagine
whatever validation structure you want
to run here, you run it. And you can see
here if something goes wrong, we're
going to return a set of issues. The key
here is to direct your agent once
something goes wrong. So we have this
line here. Um when we're building out
our response to our agent after it's
called this validation command, we're
saying the following. Resolve this CSV
error in and then we're specifying the
file path. And then we're just going to
unload all the errors for our agent to
resolve. So let's go ahead and test this
in a new terminal window here. Cloud
code instance running opus. And then we
have a brand new / csvedit. There's our
argument hints thanks to our hint
parameter right here. Now we can just
pass in a CSV file to edit. So we're
going to use one of our mock csv files
here in the codebase. Mach input data
raw savings in February. And I'll just
copy the reference to that. Paste. And
now we're going to make a request. I'll
just do something simple. read and
report on the file structure. And so
this is going to be simple, right? We're
not actually doing a CSV edit here.
Maybe I could have named this something
a little different, but you get the
idea, right? This agent can read, edit,
and write. Let's see what it's doing
here. It found the file location, and
now it's just going to report on the
data structure. As you know, the magic
here is that after our agent runs, so
you know, here's our great report.
Nothing too fancy, nothing too
interesting here, right? But our agent
has run this self validation. The big
idea here is this is a self- validation
specific to this use case. I I can't
stress that enough how important it is
that this self- validation is hyper
focused on this purpose of this prompt.
The prompt extends to the sub agent
extends to the skill whatever you know
format whatever packaging you're putting
your prompts in that doesn't really
matter. Remember it all boils down to
the core four context model prompt
tools. In the end, every abstraction is
that this adds a powerful deterministic
layer that is again specialized. Let me
show you the result. This is one of the
reasons why it's so important to have
observability and to really log
everything. You can see here we have
output for our CSV single validator. And
you can see that everything passed fine.
We were able to perfectly parse this CSV
file. It is in fact a valid CSV file.
Now, let's break it and let's see what
our agent does when it has a specialized
self validation tool that can run. I'm
just going to break the CSV. I'm going
to remove this last quote here. Let's
see what happens now. Right? So, I'm
going to clear out this agent. So, it
has no information. I can just hit up
here a couple times. Right? So, CSV edit
same file report on the data structure.
Now, watch what happens here. This is
where the real magic is. It read and
right away because it ran that red hook,
it broke. And then our validator said,
"Hey, resolve this error that we found."
And the agent immediately fixed it. Now,
it's going to rerun. It's actually doing
that report properly. and it mentions
that fixed issue. So what happened
there? You know exactly what happened,
right? We've been working up to this
step by step. Our post tool use hook ran
and it inserted determinism into our
agents workflow. All right, so not only
did it do whatever we asked it to do
here and you know we're running a super
simple example. I'm sure some engineers
are thinking, "Wow, that was so simple.
Why are you just having a single, you
know, 20 line prompt for CSV validation
for updating CSV? You don't need that.
Blah blah blah blah blah. The models are
good enough now. Stop. Full stop,
please. You want to be building focused
agents that do one thing extraordinarily
well. Why is that? That is because a
focus agent with one purpose outperforms
an unfocused agent with many purposes,
right? With many tasks, with many end
states. We can now push this even
further with specialized hooks that we
can embed in our prompts, sub aents, and
skills. Why is this so important? This
is critically important because we can
push specialization further. My CSV
agent can now validate its work in a
deterministic way. This is ultra
powerful. I'm shocked that more
engineers aren't talking about this. I
think it really shows the kind of weird
gap right now. There's a lot of vibe
coding happening. Even engineers are
starting to just vibe code and turn
their brain off. Don't get lazy. Stay
sharp. Keep learning. And one of the key
ways to do that is guys, you have to
read the documentation. Actually sit
down and read the documentation. I'm
seeing way way too many engineers and
vibe coders just you come to the top of
the page, copy, you open up your Hunter
coding tool, you paste it in and you say
build PC of this. Okay. When you do
this, you learn absolutely nothing. The
whole journey of learning is the
journey. In the end, you gain that
knowledge for every other time. But when
you do stuff like this, right, and you
don't actually read the documentation,
you don't know what your agent is doing.
That is vibe coding. That is, you know,
leaning too heavy on the vibes if you
ask me, right? Because what's the
problem with this? The big key
difference between real engineering and,
you know, vibe coding or whatever you
want to call it, vibing, vibe
engineering, I don't really care what
term is used. Uh, the big difference is
that engineers know what their agents
are doing. Okay? if you want to know
what they're doing, you have to know and
you have to read the documentation of
the thing you're building against.
There's just no way around this. Um, so
anyway, small side rant. Um, I'm seeing
way too many engineers uh outsource
learning. That is how you begin the
self-deprecation process. You stop
learning. Highly recommend you just, you
know, take the time, read through the
documentation, understand what you can
do so you can teach your agents to do
it. Okay. Um, so anyway, so this is very
powerful. Our agent resolved that error
on its own. And now anytime I run this a
CSV edit, the agent is going to validate
it when it finishes. Okay. And that's
it. You can, if you want, you can stop
the video now. That's that's it. Self
validation is now specializable. Before
we were stuck writing global hooks in
our settings.json file like this, you
know, you would write out the hook here.
And that was great, very important, very
powerful. You'll still want to do stuff
like that. For instance, we built out a
cloud code damage control skill that
protects your codebase and just like
very quickly sets up, you know, powerful
hooks to block commands. But what we get
here is something really, really
powerful, something really
extraordinary. It is specialized self
validation. You've heard me say it a 100
times. That's really what's happening
here, right? This is the one idea I
wanted to share with you today. Now,
this is just the prompt, right? Let's go
ahead and see what this looks like
inside of a sub agent and a skill. It
looks very similar, but there are a
couple, you know, caveats and couple
things to mention along the way.
If we open up the release notes here, so
I'll just search for hooks. It's insane
that this valuable feature was just kind
of buried into this list of bullet
points, but the cloud code team has been
absolutely cooking. Anyway, so what am I
trying to say here? There's a weird
thing that's happening right now where
the Cloud Code team is kind of combining
skills and custom slash commands into
one. I'm not really a huge fan of this.
Uh, let me just search for skill, I
guess. Right. Yeah, merge slash command
and skills. Very, very interesting. I
think the team maybe realized that they
truly did just build out a another way
to run slash commands, which again kind
of validates our our foundational idea
that we talk about on the channel all
the time with the core 4. Everything
just turns into a prompt that runs into
your agent. Context model prompt tools.
You've heard me say it a million times.
I'm going to say it a million more times
because a lot of information out there
around agents is very hype fililled and
very uh kind of void of raw information.
Oftent times in engineering when you're
learning a new skill when you're
building up a portfolio of expertise
there's really like four foundational
facts that if you understand them and
master them you will go uh
extraordinarily far and you'll become
very very capable. The core four is one
of them and you know you can see that
here. merge/comands and skills. They're
the same thing. It's a prompt. So
anyway, just wanted to mention that.
Let's see what self validating inside of
sub aents and skills looks like. I'm
going to hop over to agents. You can see
I have a few agents here. We want a
CSVedit agent. All right, so we're going
to build the exact same thing but as an
agent. So what do agents give us? Agents
give us two key things over a prompt.
They give us parallelization, right? So
we can parallelize our work. We can
deploy multiple agents at one time. And
they also give us context isolation and
effectively delegate our context window.
I have a snippet for this ag. This can
be an agentic agent. And you can see
here we have that same kind of format.
All of our options listed out right
away. And then we can dial into exactly
what we want. Right? So I like to just
give myself all the options when I'm
working and then I can dial it down or
of course I can have an agent dial it
down as well. CSV edit agent. And I'm
just going to do some copying here from
our previous prompt here. use only when
directly requested. And then I'll say
CSVEit agent just to make that super
clear. We don't need all these tools. In
fact, we can just mirror our tools from
our prompt. And we don't need
disallowed. There's our model permission
mode. We can just get rid of that
skills. We're not going to be using a
skill. And then we have our hooks. Same
deal. We're going to delete pre delete
stop. And I'm just going to go ahead and
copy over this. And what else? I deleted
something there. Oh, the color. Sure,
Sam. And I'm just going to copy the
exact same prompt too. So, you know,
you'll notice this looks very, very
similar, right? The structure is very
similar, a little bit different because
remember prompts can intake arguments
whereas sub aents just kind of take the
prompt that's passed into them. And so,
we might tweak something like this. Pull
from prompt and then pull from prompt or
like determine from prompt is probably
better language here. Fantastic. So, we
can do the same thing. Let's kill this
agent. And our agentic workflow probably
completed. Nice. We had an 8minute
agentic workflow that automatically
agentically handled my finances for this
month. And of course, I'm using mock
data. It's not actually my finances. We
got a great breakdown here. We'll circle
back to this in just a moment. I want to
show you the sub agent using specialized
selfidation. And what we'll do is we'll
deploy one agent per file. Again, that's
what sub agents give you. They give you
parallelization so that you can scale
your agents across multiple versions.
Use one CSV edit agent per file in mock
input data and append three new rows two
expenses file we properly increment the
balance okay because in these CSV files
you know you can see here we will have a
balance and let me actually turn on my
UI for this so you can see here we have
a balance and this moves upward so when
this moves up we add 650 here because
this is a deposit that's why I added
that line right make sure that the
balance is are correct. As we move
upward, we're going to kick off four CSV
agents in parallel to edit each one of
these files. There you go. You can see
we are starting to stack these up. And
again, the big idea here is that after
every one of these agents run, they're
going to validate the file they just
operated in. Not only do we have
individual prompts that can self-
validate, we have sub agents that we can
scale that self- validate. Okay, really
think about this. Really think about
this. This is specialized self-
validation. You can scale specific
commands, right? Check out my other
commands here. Build.m MD. I have a
llinter. I have a formatter running here
using the brand new astral uvty and
rough tooling. You know, this is going
to run after my build agent runs every
single time. Okay? So, we have two hooks
running here on stop. So, when the agent
finishes, it's going to look over all
the code here only when the build agent
runs, right? So, we're not running
commands when we don't need them. We run
them in specific use cases. This is just
two simple examples of this, right? You
can really really scale this all the way
down to the prompt, but then you can
push it into your own agents and your
own skills. And so this is where this
gets really powerful. Imagine you're
doing a migration. Imagine you're
updating some fields in the database.
Imagine you're doing any type of work
that you yourself would come in and
validate. You can now teach your agents
to do this. This is a big idea we talk
about all the time. This is a closed
loop prompt now. Okay? And we don't even
have to prompt engineer it anymore. You
still can if you wanted to, right? You
could say something like this. Validate
your work with XYZ, right? So you would
say UV run blah blah blah blah blah CSV.
You might need to build an additional,
you know, in agent validation command
because the inputs here are a little bit
different, but you get the idea, right?
You can still do this. There's nothing
wrong with this. But the massive benefit
of throwing this inside the hook is that
you know this will always run. Okay? And
so every time one of these tools are
called inside of this agent, it is going
to validate its work. Okay? This is a
guarantee. And this is why, you know,
the Ralph Wiggum technique, all these
kind of prompts plus code, agents plus
code, these techniques are starting to
gain popularity. It's for this reason.
You're adding trust into the system.
You're having your agents validate their
own work. That saves you time. You're
not doing the validation. You're just
making sure that you set the system up
right. And this is a big theme we're
going to see moving forward in the age
of agents. You know, the engineers that
are building the agentic system in
tactical agentic coding. We call this
the new ring around your codebase. You
don't work on your application anymore.
You work on the agents that run your
application. Okay? And the big idea here
is that you can now have agents that you
quite literally trust more by just
adding the right hooks, the right
validation. Ralph Wiggum, all these
techniques on the channel, we've
discussed this. Agents plus code beats
agents. Okay, that's it. It's that
simple. That's what self validation is.
That's what the closed loop prompt is.
This is what it looks like to really
teach your agents how to build an
engineer like you would, right? It's
it's by doing things like this. Every
engineer, every good engineer at least,
validates their work. And soon it's
going to be the exact same thing with
your agents. Every good specialized
agent, great at doing one thing well,
will validate that one thing. Okay? I'm
I'm very against this kind of generalist
do it all super omni agent where you
just nuke the context window over and
over. I I'm highly convicted that if you
want to build an agent that outperforms
over and over and over, you build a
focus specialized agent. Even down to
something like this, right? This is a
real agent that I would build out
CSVEdit agent. We just edit CSV files.
That's it. It's not that you can't do
this with a, you know, bigger agent
doing 10 20 different things. Opus is
very powerful. It can do that. That's
not the point. The point is that this
will perform better over tens, hundreds,
thousands, and millions of runs. Okay?
If you want to scale, you want your
agents self validating and not just any
validation. You want your agents
specializing their self validation. All
right? So, that's the value here. We
don't need to walk through building the
skill. You know what that looks like.
You know, you do CSV edit skill and then
you, you know, build out skill.md. And
then I have a coach template for this.
basically more or less the same thing.
So, I'm not going to build this out. You
get the idea here. I'm going to go and
just delete this and I'll go ahead and
commit the other two and you'll have
access to this codebase if you want to
poke around what's happening here and
understand how you can, you know, build
out some more self validation. But you
can see all those four agents ran in
parallel. They validated their work and
we can prove it. Again, you want to have
proof that these things ran hooks and
CSV single validator. We can scroll to
the bottom here and you can see every
one of those files was validated at
basically the same time within a second,
right? That's because we use
parallelism. We have edits that we know
worked. Okay, let me just say that
again. We have edits from our agent that
we know worked because we gave them the
tools to validate their own work.
You know, you can see here we had a
bunch of stuff run and it outputed
something like this, right? So, all we
did was pass in a CSV and it gave us
this. Here was our previous version,
January 2026. And here's our new version
here. Sorry for the uh light glare
changes there. But you know, just a
simple highle view of finances. This is
a real use case of generative UI, by the
way. Um, some of this is static that I
had the agent generate over and over.
Some of it is dynamic. So, some of these
tables that it created. I had no idea it
was going to create. You know, you can
see here we have a bunch of insights
about our spending for the month, right?
All the way down to the table level. We
can sort this. We can see our burn. we
can see our income balance blah blah
blah. I know some people don't trust
models and model providers to do stuff
like this. I think it's totally fine.
This is what this tool did, right? We
had a full agent pipeline build this
out, a team of agents. And once again, I
can tell you I was very, very confident
that this was going to work end to end.
Okay? And why is that? You already know
what I'm going to say. If we open up
this prompt, review finances. I had a
single prompt and we can go and collapse
this. You can see I'm once again using
our great agentic workflow pattern.
Nothing new. It's the same thing over
and over and over. Um, you'll notice
that about this channel. We are very
consistent and we're always focused on
using the best tools for the job. All
right. Hyperfocus on the signal in the
industry, not hype, not noise, not
anything else. And you can see here,
right? You can see something very
powerful. I have an HTML validator
running here on the top level. Frankly,
on the review finances, this is the kind
of super workflow. So you can see here
this workflow is actually kicking off
multiple agents underneath it. All
right, we have the agent chain here. So
we are chaining together multiple
agents, multiple steps. And you know,
you can see here we're running a whole
slew of different specialized agents.
Guess what they're going to do? Yes,
they're all going to validate their
work. Let's hop into our categorize CSV
agent. Check that out. Let's hop into
our uh generative UI agent. There's that
HTML validator. Let's hop into our merge
accounts. There's a CSV validator. On
and on and on. And you can see here we
have this normalized CSV agent actually
running two validators. And these are
running on the stop command. So when it
stops, I'm running some kind of global
validators that run on all the files in
this codebase because why not just test
all the files. Kind of general rule of
thumb, if you want to test a bunch of
files at the end of your specialized
hooks, you can use the stop hook. And if
you want to test just one file like we
did, you probably want to go for that,
you know, post tool use so that inside
of your script, you get access to the
the path that was read, edited, or
written to. Feel free to check out this
codebase. I built this as a kind of
working prototype to quickly run finance
review to calculate, you know, expenses
and income for the month. Make sure you
have this in your own private codebase
if you decide to fork this, pull ideas
from it, whatever. The big idea here is
you can build out specialized self
validators inside of your prompts, your
sub agents, and your skills. Now, and if
you're really pushing this stuff, um,
you can do something really, really
cool. If we close this, we run claw--p
uh, settings. You can inside of your
primary agent pass in an entire settings
file as JSON and that includes hooks.
All right, I'm just going to leave you
with that idea. You can take validating
agents to another level with this.
Comment down below. Let me know how
you're using hooks. I'm super curious if
you have turned on specialized hooks. If
this is the first time you're seeing
this, no problem. It's really not
getting enough attention. Engineers, you
got to be careful. You got to make sure
you're still learning and still
internalizing knowledge. Don't delegate
learning to your agent. All right? It
doesn't do you or them any good outside
of that one shot that they run in. All
right? So, make sure you're still
reading the docs. Make sure you're still
following, you know, the big releases
coming out of these leading tools,
technologies. Obviously, cloud code is
the leader in agentic coding and it
allows us therefore to tap into this new
role of engineering we're calling
agentic engineering. Opus 4.5 has been
changing the game for a while and it's
very clearly a step change forward into
the future of engineering. But be very
careful with this stuff. Do not overuse
these models to the point where you're
not learning anymore. That's kind of the
meta idea I just want to, you know,
leave you with here today. All the
potential we can have with agents is
incredible. But if you delegate the
learning process to your agents, you
will be stuck. You will not continue to
grow. And the worst thing any engineer
can do is start the self-deprecation
process by not learning anything new.
All right, definitely check out
specialized self- validation in the form
of hooks inside of your custom/comands,
aka prompts, your sub aents, and your
skills. You know where to find me every
single Monday. Stay focused and keep
building.
