It's 7:30 in the morning and you're a
hotshot agentic engineer getting ahead
on the new year. You crack open your
terminal and fire up the best agent
coding tool claude code running open 4.5
in yolo mode. You're running Claude in
your 7 figureure revenue generating
codebase and you scaled it to this level
with your powerful/ sentient command.
This command does your job for you. But
today something goes wrong. Your agent
had too much compute last night and it
starts hallucinating at the worst
possible time back to backto back
running damaging commands. Thankfully,
they were all caught by your clawed code
hooks, your local hooks, your global
hooks, and your prompt hooks. You even
set up prompt requests where if your
agent is unsure, it's going to ask you,
"We don't want to delete this user, so
we're going to go down and we're going
to type skip." Every catastrophic
command that your agent tried to run was
blocked. You think back to that Andy
Devdan video you watched and you think
about that clawed code damage control
you learned that prevented your agents
from running catastrophic irreversible
double Thanos snap career destroying
commands. This can happen at any time to
any engineer. Obviously I set up this
example as a proof of concept to
showcase this idea to you. If you delete
your codebase, your git repo, or your
production database, like we've seen the
vibe coders do over and over, it doesn't
matter how fast, powerful, or autonomous
your agents are. All of your months and
years of hard work can be evaporated in
a single misinterpreted or hallucinated
command. Today in this video, we're
going to enhance your agentic coating
and add the armor to your production
systems it needs to prevent irreversible
damage. I have this all configurable in
a simple skill you can use to both
install and manage your hooks. Let's
start the new year outright by not
deleting our most valuable engineering
resources we work so hard for.
This dangerous mock command/s sentient
showcased several unique damage control
measures through clawed code hooks.
Local hooks, global hooks, ask
permission functionality and the prompt
hook. Most engineers don't know about
prompt hooks, so let's start there. I
want to show you how you can quickly set
this up end to end and then we'll jump
right into the prompt hook. The setup
here is very simple. We're going to spin
up a new terminal window here. We're
going to go to temp. Let's go ahead and
get the clone command for this. I'll
have this linked in the description for
you. I'll hit code, copy, get clone,
fire that off, cd into claw code damage
control, and then right away, we'll just
boot up cloud code here. All you have to
do to get started is type /install.
Now, while this is running, I'm going to
open up a new tab here and just open
this up. We'll go ahead and use cursor
here. And this /install command is a new
pattern I'm going to be using more often
where we can set up interactive
installation processes. So you can see
here our agent is asking us where would
you like to install this? We can install
this at the global level, the project
level or the personal level. Let's go
ahead and run with project. Our agent is
going to help us work through the
process of setting this up in a very
seamless way. It's checking the
existence of a settings file to see if
it has to create or merge. And now it's
asking us, do we want Python or
TypeScript? We want Python. So we'll
just hit enter there. And now it's going
to aentically finish the setup process.
So this is a cool pattern you can use. I
like to call this prompt just
slashinstall. And then you can create a
workflow using the ask user question
tool to kind of guide engineers on your
team and yourself when you are operating
in other codebases or reusing a skill
for a specific purpose. Our agent has
finished the installation. You can get a
nice breakdown here. The most important
thing here is that our agent is
communicating to us what's happened and
what we need to do next. We need to
restart our agent for these hooks to
take effect. So, we'll do that first.
You won't always know what the deletion
command is going to be. And so, here's
an example, right? This is a simple one.
It's not as destructive. This is going
to look for all clawed hooks in this
directory. It's going to look for files
and then it's going to try to delete
them. As you'll see in a moment, we
don't have deterministic hooks to catch
this exact command. This can be very
dangerous. I've been engineering for
over 15 years and I'm still learning and
finding new commands, some of them
destructive. When we run this, check
this out. Our system is going to catch
this command even though it's never seen
it before because we are running a
destructive command. You can see here
the prompt hook condition was not met.
Now, if we open up the codebase, we can
see this in settings.json. JSON. This is
where we configure all of our hooks. And
this is what our skill set up for us
agentically with that install command.
If we just close this, close this. We'll
check out these commands in a second. We
have that permissions block down here.
If we just look at this, we have a
pre-tool use matcher, which is the place
to catch commands before they run. We're
looking for all bash commands. And then
we have two hooks. Now, this is
something that a lot of engineers don't
know exists. Most engineers know about
deterministic hooks where you run a
script. Here we're using Astral UV. You
can also set this up with bun as you saw
in the setup. But you can also do this.
You can run a prompt against this. Now
it's very important to mention that
whatever you put in this prompt is
fantastic and you should consider this
an additional guard. As soon as you find
that command, right? For instance, as
soon as you find this new database table
deletion, psql command or whatever
frameworks or tools you're looking for,
your Google cloud, your AWS CLI
commands, once you find those hard,
dangerous commands, you should add them
to your deterministic hook. This is
essentially a lastditch effort. That's
the way I like to think about the prompt
pre-tool use hook. It's very powerful to
catch things that you haven't explicitly
caught, but right after you find it, you
want to encode it. All right? And
remember, the whole idea here is that
you want to prevent from having your
most valuable assets deleted by mistake
or on purpose from your agent.
Hallucination or a bad prompt that you
wrote, it doesn't matter how it happens,
right? The problem is just that there is
a chance that your agents can
permanently damage your production
assets. And this helps us completely
prevent that.
Now, we can of course also catch more
traditional things inside of this
installation here. You can see several
scripts that were built out. And you'll
also notice a patterns file. Now, if
you've worked with hooks before, you
know what these scripts are, right? The
bash tool damage control is what we have
right here. And this is going to make
sure that we don't run any commands that
we don't want to run. Now, the cool
thing that we're doing here is we're
looking at a list of patterns. This is a
lightweight wrapper around the hooks
capability where you can come into this
file and have specific commands that you
never want to run. You can just write it
out here. And by you, I of course mean
you can prompt your agent to add
something here. You can see we're
disallowing a bunch of commands here. So
let's just go ahead and and test one of
these. So if we commanded something like
run to rm read me, this is going to be a
blocked command. We have this in our
patterns file that then is loaded by our
primary file. This is just a command
that our agent cannot run. Okay? And so
this is a classic just pre-tool use
blocked command. This is great. This is
what you really want to rely on, right?
Most of your damage control is going to
be inside of pre-tool use. And what I've
built here inside of the skill, it's
going to just create these bash tool
patterns, which are just regex commands
that you can prompt your agent to use
and update to prevent certain commands.
So this is a local pre-tool use hook
that is preventing action. Fantastic.
Sometimes though the commands you want
to block are not so clear and what you
actually want is to have your agent ask
you. And so in this pattern with our
patterns.yaml combined with the scripts
that have been written here we can do
something like this. We can say ask
colon and you can see here we have a ask
flag on this SQL operation.
So this is an example where you just
want your agent to ask you if you can
run this thing. And we have some zero
access paths here and readon and no
deletes. We'll talk about that in just a
second. But we can run something like
this, right? And this is all coming
through the settings.json, right? This
is just traditional cloud code hooks.
All we're doing here is layering on a
simple pattern zaml file to quickly add
and modify things we want to have
blocked or things we want to have our
agent ask us if it can do. All right.
And this is great for inloop agent
coding. Now, let's just go and run a
command here. We have this mock database
from the git clone. And we're going to
play with that. So, let's go ahead and
open up our Asian again. Let's clear
once again, and then we'll kick off this
command. So, I'll say run this command.
And you can see here, this isn't the
most destructive command, but not
everything is a 100 to zero command.
Sometimes you want to make sure that if
your agent's going to delete something
specifically from your production
assets, you want it to ask you, right?
You want it to confirm with you. So,
it's going to run this and it's going to
actually kick off a pre-tool use ask
command. So, there we go. So, it's
asking me, should I do this or should I
not? In this case, we can do it. Or we
could say something like this, right?
Come down here and say skip. And then it
will not run that command. With this
thin lightweight patterns file we've set
up, you can just set ask true and have
your agents ask you if you want to run
that specific command based on that
specific pattern. Every one of these
scripts is relatively simple, right?
We're loading in that patterns file and
we're making sure that the incoming
command doesn't match anything we have
set up in our patterns. All right? And
this covers our pre-tool use bash and
prompt command. We have two other
commands here. Edit and of course write.
Now these are both going to just call
the respective edit and write tools. If
we open up this file, it's pretty
simple, right? We only have 100 lines
here. It's looking at this zero access
path variable from our patterns file,
right? So it's looking at this and it's
looking at read only paths inside of the
write tool. Your agent will not write to
any one of these paths. All right. And
this is just a simple once again a
simple lightweight layer we've set up on
top of cloud code hooks. If we collapse
bash tool patterns, you can see we have
zero access paths, read only paths, and
no delete paths. Sometimes you want a
little bit more granularity. So that's
what this gives you. And again, you
know, I'm not trying to prescribe one
way to run your hooks. This is just the
way I found is really valuable. So, I'm
rolling this into a skill that you can
use for all of your code bases. And it's
as easy to set up as opening up an
agent, get clone the codebase, and then
you just type /install in any one of
your new codebases. So, just copy the
skill directory in. You can just run the
prompt from the install. Install the
damage control system, and then our
skill is going to take it from there.
But this is a cool way to prevent access
to files in a more granular way. All
right, so we have zero access path. So,
we're blocking our agents from
accessing, reading, or writing or doing
anything in these files. All right, you
probably want to change these. That's
fine. Feel free to do so. We also have
readonly paths and we have no delete
paths, right? So, we cannot delete
anything from hooks or commands. Now,
let's just test this out. Some engineers
like to give their agents the ability to
access and modify these files. This by
default is a read only. So, we can test
this, right? So, if we open up the
terminal here, we can do something
dangerous. We can say delete this. So
you can see here Claude Code has really
great builtin understanding of these
files. It's asking me if I'm really sure
and it's doing it this naturally. So
this is why this tool is fantastic. It's
trained on not deleting important files.
We're going to really trust the system
and go ahead and delete the batch RC.
And of course our hook system is going
to prevent this, right? because we have
no delete access on the bash rc
and cloud code is being just the
absolute goat and it's it's creating a
backup here too. So I chose a terrible
file, right? Cloud code is already
really good at this stuff. It's going to
create a backup here and then it's going
to actually run this deletion command
and the deletion command is not going to
work. All right, and it looks like our
prompt hook caught this one. Um it's
important to mention that your commands
here inside of your settings, these all
run in parallel. So, whichever one
finishes first is the one that gets
kicked off. It looks like our prompt for
some reason somehow ran faster, which
doesn't really make sense. But you can
see here this was blocked. We chose a
terrible file there to try to change or
update. Let's go to our readonly path
and instead let's try to just append a
new item into our bash rc. So, we'll
clear this and we'll say append a
comment to this and we'll say a random
comment just so that it writes
something. And so you can see our agent
has read this file, but it's going to
try to update it and it can't update it.
All right, so this is a readonly path.
And so this is just another powerful
mechanism you can build into your hooks.
And we just have this built out. You
just don't want to think about your
security over and over and over. You
just want to have great defaults and
then you want to run with it. You can
modify any one of these. You know
exactly what this does, right? No delete
paths, readonly paths, zero access path.
So nothing can happen in our zero access
paths. All right? So if we did something
like this, ls we we'll clear first just
to get that clean setup. ls this. All
right. So we're going to try to lsr. SSH
and we have completely prevented access
to this using the cloud code hook system
and this patterns file. There we go. So
we have a zero access path here. And our
agent just couldn't access this at all.
Very powerful stuff here. This is all
easily configurable in the
patterns.yamel file and it's all
triggered by just traditional claw code
hooks. Right? There's nothing special
happening here. We have a single
additional layer inside that YAML file
that's helping us not run these
dangerous commands that can really mess
up our code bases. All right, so we have
our classic pre-tool use here. We can
block commands that we do know with
deterministic controls and we can block
commands that we had no idea about,
right? Dangerous commands that we didn't
even know existed. Our agent's going to
run a prompt on every single bash
command. Now, that's the caveat here,
right? This is going to be slow, but if
you ask me, running this prompt every
single time is going to be faster than
potentially deleting a valuable
production asset. Okay, how does this
work? How is this all set up?
When you set up this codebase, this is
what you'll start out with. It's just
this damage control skill, right, when
you clone this codebase. And so it looks
like this. We have traditional command
blocking, we have ask patterns, and then
we have path protection levels. And
here's the skill structure. You can see
the 100 foot view right here. We have
some test prompts. We have our
TypeScript version and we have our
Python version each with the patterns
file. I could probably ddup this. But
then we have the most important piece
here, the cookbook. All right. And so
the cookbook is what actually runs us
through that workflow. So let's say we
wanted to clone this into another
repository. We can get that clone
command right there. Add a dot. Copy all
this CD out. Make dur CD into this. Get
clone kickoff cloud code. and then just
rerun install. You're going to see this
exact same workflow and then we can
change where the workflow is going and
so it's going to kick off this workflow
again. So what is happening here right
it is running this cookbook. So when we
say install damage control and we can go
into markdown formatted view here
installation pathway install damage
control setup security hooks deploy
damage control or add protection it's
going to read and execute our
installation agentic workflow cookbook.
All right and so if we open up this
cookbook prompt you can see this exactly
right a classic agentic coding prompt.
If you've been with the channel, you
already know what the structure is. Here
we have a great agentic workflow where
we're going to use the ask user question
tool to walk through setting things up.
So, we had two key questions there,
right? We said, do you want uh global
setup, project level setup, or personal
level setup? And then we asked, do you
want TypeScript or bunk? All right. And
there are some other pathways in here.
For instance, if it detects a settings
file already, it's going to run a merge
workflow, right? Merge, overwrite, or
stop. And then it's going to proceed
with the rest of the steps. Right? So
you can see all the steps there is a
ninestep agentic workflow where we are
installing this tool into your hooks.
All right? And for sure there are great
cloud code plugins. Go ahead use those.
I'm not trying to you know sell you on
any one paradigm. But I wanted to build
this out and I wanted to share this with
you as I am creating a consistent
pattern for preventing my production
assets from being destroyed. I want to
share with you here so you have access
to a version that uh can help you get up
and running very very quickly. All
right, I know a decent amount of my
audience will already have hooks in
place. This is just too important to
miss so you don't end up like this guy,
right? This is what damage control is
for. So we have agenda workflows, right?
And we also have additional ones. So we
can do something like this, right? Use
the damage control skill and list all
damage controls. So, it's just going to
give us a comprehensive list of
everything our assets going to prevent
and protect against. And so, this leads
us to the the final level, global
settings.
So, there are four damage controls that
I wanted to show you, right? You have
your local project setting, classic
static hook, and then you can use
non-deterministic prompts to help you
catch commands you didn't even know
existed. Now, here we can take this to
the final level. This is another damage
control measure. You can set up global
hooks. Again, this is a thing that a lot
of engineers know exists, but they don't
have it in place. In addition to your
local hooks, you can set this up
globally so that on your device when
you're doing inloop agent coding or when
you have agents operating this machine,
your global hooks apply everywhere. All
right, these are user level hooks, but
really these are global hooks, right?
They apply on your entire device and
they get merged into your settings,
right? And if you look at the
documentation here, the cloud code
hooks, docs, they have a clear breakdown
of the hierarchy of how this works,
right? So there's user level, project
level, and local level. And then there's
an enterprise level. So back in our
damage control here, you can see our
agent is detailing all of the hooks we
have set up and all of the access paths
that are detailed here. Right? So no
delete, readon, zero access, and this is
on my project level. You can see all the
blocked commands. You can see the ass
patterns. We have no local settings file
here. But this is how you can set up
both your global which will run
everywhere project level and your local
level, right? I think it's really
important to have at least these two.
And then sometimes when you're setting
up a new codebase, you're just moving
really quickly. You'll always have your
global level settings to rely on. So
that's that. This is a simpler video. I
just wanted to come back to cloud code
hooks. We talked about these hooks when
they were released, but it's so
important to come back to. They've added
a couple new bells and whistles and I
needed to standardize a process because
I'll be honest with you, a few weeks ago
I almost ran a command that would have
been catastrophic in one of my
production applications. That was a
signal to jump back into security, jump
back into hooks, and make sure that I
have a system I can reuse very quickly.
Skills are great for this. I'm a big fan
of keeping things on the prompt level,
but when you want a reusable collection
of resources, skills are really, really
great for that. So that's why I've built
out this cloud code damage control skill
that you can use and deploy for your
work as well. I'm going to make some
tweaks to this and you know support this
codebase for a little bit and then
eventually I'll just fork it myself and
build a you know really specific version
to what I like to use. But here's a nice
public version you can check out and
take any ideas from if you're
interested. If you use cloud code and do
not have hooks on every codebase you
have in production, please, you know,
just clone this codebase. It's so
simple. I tried to make it as simple as
possible. /install after you get it set
up in the codebase you want to run in
and just walk through the process. And
you don't even need to run /install,
right? Like slinstall literally is just
this, right? Commands install. We're
just kicking off the damage control
system. Just prompt install the damage
control system. After you clone this,
you can pull in this command or you can
just pull in the skills directory,
right? It's all in here and it's all
detailed in the skill file. This is
going to be very important as we
continue to scale our compute, to scale
our impact. We're going to be running
hundreds and thousands of tool calls and
hundreds and thousands of agents. And it
only takes one bad command to destroy
your production assets. All right, it's
really important to stress that. Yes,
models are improving. Yes, Cloud Code
and Opus have great built-in protections
to prevent stuff like this, but there's
going to be a moment where you miss
something and your agent misses
something and it hallucinates and that's
all it takes, right? One out of a
100,000. Okay, that's enough to really
ruin your day. It's enough to destroy a
lot of value. And so, why not just put
the insurance in place with a tool like
this? Again, link in the description if
you want to check this out. Pull ideas
from this, make it your own, fork it,
you know the drill. It's important to
mention that sandboxes are really great
for mitigating this. A lot of what we're
going to be doing on the channel is
talking about building trust with our
agents. You can build trust or you can
defer it or you can make sure that you
don't need trust. Right? Building out
claw code hooks and having a great
deterministic and probabilistic hook
system is going to be a great way to not
require trust at all. Right? If your
agents can't run critical, liferuining
destructive commands, there is more
trust there, right? Just like you trust
the engineer on your team that you know
is not going to delete the production
database, right? Versus that new hire,
you know, you have a bit less trust. You
don't give them the keys to the car that
early. So, this is a mechanism of trust
with your agents. I have built this out.
I'm going to continue expanding this.
You should do the same, too. Make sure
your agents can't ruin all of your hard
work. We're talking days and months of
work that can be deleted in an instant.
Link available in the description. I'll
also link the agent sandbox video below
if you want to understand how you can
just completely defer trust and let your
agents run their own machines so that
they don't even need damage control. All
right, no matter what, stay focused and
keep building.
