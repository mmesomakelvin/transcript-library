Hi everyone, I'm Irene Aldridge. I've
been working on this topic of agentic AI
reinforcement learning and most
importantly probably applicable for this
audience is whether you should buy or
build your AI systems. Okay. And and
that's that's what really I'm I'm
planning to talk about today. If you
have questions, you can ask me at any
time. But it's kind of a broad talk and
of course now we have algorithms pretty
much everywhere. And their proliferation
is only going to increase. We have
algorithms in transportations like for
example if you drive you want to check
ways to see where you're going and
what's the optimal route. Communication
algorithms have been around for a very
long time now. And now we we have health
care that helps doctors diagnose you
correctly. So doctors don't have to
remember every single disease. They can
just consult AI in real time. And of
course we have disaster management like
how do we avoid major risk problems in
finance and in finance we have all sorts
of trading algorithms that they've been
working on for a long time.
[clears throat]
So just to compare AI. So our new
iteration of AI which is this agentic AI
it's it's it's more involved than
previous AIs so to speak. Okay. So we
have a classic AI where we had fixed
rules. uh and if anybody here was
trading I don't know 20 years ago you
know everything was very rulebased and
in many cases it is still today right so
we have fixed cuto offs for for certain
things just for speed right trained on
some historical data to to really help
us make decisions on on online fast and
generally we would have learning offline
right so we would have learning that we
would do like back tests and all these
other things and then we would bring
them online and and it really worked
well for well- definfined problems that
had limited reasoning. Okay. So then we
have this generative AI which is of
course Chad GPT and still all the rage
everywhere and and that one is really
prompt dependent, right? So, so you have
to ask it to do or to reason or to it's
it's really there's a lot of human
interaction involved in order to direct
where the generated AI is going and it
kind of struggles sometimes with
ambiguity and and it it's really needs a
lot of prompting to to deliver the
output versus what we're going to talk
about today is really this agentic AI
which is autonomous. Okay, so this is
our dream or as Elon Musk put, you know,
the source of universal income that's
coming. That's basically we're going to
have an army of robots doing everything
for us. And that's that's the utopia,
you know. So, and these robots will be
able to plan and coordinate among each
other and integrate different reasoning
and also they would have self-driven
control and all of these wonderful
things. And the question is like how do
we build them and whether you should
build it or buy it? And that's what
we're going to talk about today.
&gt;&gt; Irene, we do have one question. Robert
says, "Hi, I've been building my own
trading bot." The real question is, can
you compete with the professionals
involved in algo trading?
&gt;&gt; This is a very good question and I think
I may be able to answer this through
this presentation because I have pretty
detailed slides on how these bots are
built. So maybe I'll be able to answer
in let's say half an hour. Is that a
deal? And the reason for that is it
depends right. So it depends on on your
comfort with new technologies and and
this is what this talk is really
designed to do is is to provide the
overview of what is this new agenda KI
and how we actually build it. Okay. So I
I know I referenced the paper that kind
of recently wrote with the students at
Cornell financial engineering program
and that one just kind of outlined how
agents interact and and how they're
going to work in different functional
situations. But today I'm really
focusing on on kind of nuts and bolts
and how you actually build these
systems. Okay. So hopefully this will
this is a great question and hopefully
I'll be able to answer. So just to put
this in this evolution of AI in the
picture level. So to Robert's point,
this is how all of us human traders were
about 30 or 20 years ago on the left,
right? So this is how rulebased systems
and and kind of like a personal
computer, you know, looks a little
clunky here. And then over the last well
definitely since 2021 right we moved
into chat GPT world where now we can
query the cloud and and ask different
solutions and different answers
sometimes the answers are better than
others but but again what we're moving
towards is this complete selfcontrolled
self-driven environment where there's
there's full automation right so I don't
know what what we're going to be doing
in this world with an Elon Musk maybe
maybe all smoking weed or something.
But it's good to know how these
algorithms are built because you know
somebody will have to build them you
know eventually they will build
themselves as well right but there has
to be some human feedback to make sure
that they they don't just let's say
enslave us for example anyway that's
extreme sorry but basically this is a
standard like sample architecture of
these AI algorithms and and it's very
complex you know and it can be more
complex or less complex but they're
they're pretty pretty complicated and
what we're looking to forward is even
more complexity, right? So, we're we're
looking to to these algorithms joining
forces and com combining working in
human-like teams and you know taking
different layers and available
information into account to really come
up with some really intelligent
solutions and in the process also to do
all of this independently.
So, that's a pretty lofty task. In
addition, all of these algorithm
solutions are very highly sensitive to
tuning. Okay, so some of them are
parameterized more so than others and
and they're there are different aspects
and and we'll talk about this today as
well, different different components
that you can control and in some cases
if you you know tweak one parameter a
little bit, it produces really high
impact. So, especially when you're
getting something off the shelf like in
a black box, it's extremely hard to say
from just looking at the box or speaking
with the person who is selling the box
what's going on. Okay. So, in this talk,
basically my objective is twofold. Is to
really go through what's inside of these
algorithms. Okay? And if so, how would
you evaluate them? Okay? if if you
decide to buy them instead of building
them. Even if you decide to build them,
how do you validate your output in an
effective manner? And this is something
I've been working on and I have a bunch
of papers coming out on this. But my
background is I'm electrical engineer
and then I went to financial engineering
masters. I stayed for PhD there. It
didn't end well twice. So I've done my
MBA at INSEAD. I I worked in in credit
pricing, high frequency trading, market
microstructure, big data, reinforcement
learning. I worked for various banks. I
worked for startups. I worked for myself
a lot. I've had several successful
startups. But I really want to get a PhD
if there's anybody here with with
influence. Preferably somewhere around
New York City because that's where I'm
based. But yeah, and I also do
consulting. All right. So, I've been
teaching at Cornell for the past 10
years. I'm actually teaching a course at
John Hopkins this spring on crypto as
well. So basically I love academia and I
would love to do more there but I can't
do anything without a PhD. So I would
really really like a PhD anyway. So
that's that's separate. So these are
some of the books that I have written
and big data science all of a sudden
took off like this year. So I think it's
a very good book but anyway so so it's
it's on fire now. That's the one on the
right that came out in 2021. So let's
move into this agentic environment. So
basically what we're building is
formerly known as reinforcement learning
and reinforcement learning is a backbone
of all these agentic systems and the
difference from traditional systems is
that we have this robot right which
we're building a bot and this bot can be
you know fully formed with limps and
everything or it can be just a computer
program and the idea is that this bot
faces an uncertain environment. Okay, so
it's not just that its face is uncertain
environment and the environment can be
very non-stationary, right? So the
parameters of the environment can be
changing all the time, but it's also
that this bot is going to learn from
this environment. Okay, so this bot is
starting from maybe some back tests, but
maybe no back test whatsoever. And as
this bot goes and makes actions,
basically makes decisions, it's going to
observe the feedback that it's getting
and it's going to incorporate this
feedback into its data set on the basis
of which it's going to make future
decisions. Okay, so that's what the
difference is from traditional systems
that we use in a lot of econometrics
where we have a back test or maybe you
know that we very fancily fold over
several times to to make it as stable as
possible inference as stable as
possible. But in traditional
econometrics like unless we're actually
using some rolling window or something
along those lines, we don't really
incorporate future data into account.
Right? Here we're explicitly
incorporating future information we do
not yet know. Okay, so that's the key
that we do not know what's what we're
going to encounter in the future and
that's what we're working with. So how
are we going to do this? Well, this
technique is very much related to
bandits models that have been around
since at least 1950s, right? And I don't
know if any of you are old enough to
remember. I'm not, but back before the
casinos machines were all automated like
they're now. And right now they're
measuring your eye pupil dilating and
and your pulse, you know, all of these
wonderful things to keep you like
completely hooked on their machine and
spend all the money you have. Before
that, they used to be mechanical. Okay,
so this is an example of a banded
machine here on screen. You have three
rolls with pictures, right? and they're
completely mechanical and then you have
this one lever and you pull the lever
once and these pictures move around and
if they align in a certain formation you
would get a payout otherwise you will
not. Okay. So the question that at that
time researchers were were struggling
with is how do we predict you know at
which point we should stop playing
because we maximized our payout and
that's how this whole bandit bandit
models came about. So we're reacting to
the information that we're getting and
we are acting accordingly and what we're
going to do is we're going to build this
as a mark of matrix as a mark of
decision process where we're going to
assume discrete states although in in
later it durations we can relax that
assumptions but generally we would going
to assume some discrete states and based
on our actions and based on the reward
we're getting in each state we're going
to take different actions.
and we're going to move from state to
state and and our objective is to
optimize this basically network effect
in perpetuity. Okay, so we're making
some action that causes us to move to a
different state and causes us to receive
a certain award and this is going to go
on forever and we're trying to estimate
the net present value of that future
reward that we do not yet know in
today's terms so we can make as good
decisions as possible. And these are the
same techniques that are used by like
the alpho which which has shown to beat
human reasoning in different games or
chess. So this this is we're talking
about the same kind of idea of look
forward and reason backwards. Okay. So
we're looking forward and we're
extrapolating the best possible move
given the future future conditions. So
basically we're observing some states S.
We're taking action A and we're
receiving reward R. And our objective is
to formulate policy pi which is
depending on our action and conditional
on the state S that we're in to
maximizes cumulative future reward.
Sorry, this is very crude but this is
sum of rewards and discounted by factor
gamma. Okay, so we want to take it's a
net present value future rewards. So
we're applying a discount factor. Again
discount factor is subjective depends on
your opportunity cost and things like
that. So there are three key approaches
to solving that. The first one is known
as value based methods and really the
value based methods they maximize our
future reward. Okay. So so we're really
trying to get derived policies that
maximize our cumulative future reward.
And then there are policy gradient
methods. And what we want to do here is
we want to minimize the error. Okay? So
we want to make sure that instead of
maximizing the value directly, we're
going to minimize the the bad decisions
essentially, right? So this is this is
the policy gradient methods. And then we
have actual critical methods that
combine both. Okay? So this is more like
a neural network approach where we
maximize decisions going forward and
then we minimize errors going back.
Okay. But in this case we're doing it at
the same time. And these are basically
the three different approaches and
different techniques use these different
approaches in different ways. They
combine them as we'll see. They combine
them in different ways. Okay. But
fundamentally that's what it is. Okay.
So another thing that's very very
different in reinforcement learning from
neural network, neural network is almost
deterministic. You feed it some data and
it runs and runs and runs and runs in
the loop until it finds the optimal
parameters and then it spits out some
output. Okay, so the problem with the
neural network it can get stuck in some
local minimum or local maximum, right?
So it can get stuck and that's it,
right? And there's nothing much you
could do. What reinforcement learning
does it adds exploration. What what that
means is every once in a while and again
you determine how often your
reinforcement learning goes off tangent.
So instead of just following a
prescribed optimal policy that it has
been following for a long time, it's
going to go and do something crazy
random and you again control how crazy
its actions can be. But the idea is that
it does something unexpected to
potentially learn something better, you
know, so potentially to break out of its
current routine and get into something,
you know, unexpected and more
interesting. So that's the key addition
in reinforcement learning that that
makes it actually adds a lot of kind of
intelligence, if you will, but also out
of the box thinking. And here are the
core structures in in reinforcement
learning. I'm not going to quiz you on
this. But all of them have lots of lots
of different acronyms. You know, I'm I'm
happy to discuss all of them off offline
in detail. But there's a deep
deterministic policy gradient, twin
delayed deep deterministic policy
gradient, soft actor critic, proximal
policy optimization, model based
reinforcement learning and
distributional reinforcement learning
and asynchronous advantage actor critic.
And these are just to name a few. Okay,
so there are many many more than that.
And if you look at my paper on agendic
AI, you'll see some some more
complicated structure there. But just to
to give you a flavor what's going on
here. So this deep deterministic policy
gradient, it combines an actor and a
critic. Okay? So the actor has some
average preferred action based on the
current state. All right? And then the
critic is really maximizes make sure
that this this action is actually
optimal. And then we add some noise.
Okay, so we add some exploration noise.
And of course we have potential bias and
there other issues. There's a recent
paper that showed that these if you put
these multiple agents deep deterministic
policy graded agents into the same
system, they actually create a lot of
noise. Okay. So and and this noise
inhibits further learning. So you have
this bunch of agents and they just
basically create random actions and then
the other agents are observing those
random actions and they're learning from
them and it basically creates a big
mess. Especially in financial markets
that's kind of a big deal, right? So
this is something we can expect as more
agents coming online. If they're using
this particular strategy then there's
going to be a lot of noise. We're
literally adding like random noise
generating process into our actions to
do something different every time. Then
we have this twin delayed deep
deterministic policy gradient where now
we have two critics not just one but
two. Okay. And they all act like
sequentially. So we have actor critic
critic actor critic critic. So basically
actor gets to go only every three steps
right and to criticize it more than that
the actor actually has chances to move.
So there's more overestimation but it's
also more stable. You know you have
fewer issues that you had with this
deterministic policy gradient because
there was so much noise in the system.
So here it's a little bit better. Okay.
And we really take this gausian noise
but but we kind of constrain it. So we
clip it so it doesn't go crazy as as the
previous thing does. Then we have a soft
actor critic and here we're actually
maximizing our entropy. Okay, so we're
maximizing our reward and entropy. So
we're we're looking to explore more but
specifically not in random directions
like we did in DDPG. Okay, here just we
completely randomly do did whatever we
want. Here we're exploring in directions
where it matters most, where our reward
changes considerably, preferably
increases. So we're relying on entropy
to help us understand which way we
should go so that we actually have a
chance at at changing our situation
considerably instead of just creating
noise. Okay, so this is this is a little
bit better. In this soft actor critic we
have uh a policy that we develop. We
also adjust entropy automatically and we
have principal exploration.
Exploitation. So exploration again is is
when we add noise and and create random
paths and exploitation is where we work
our established strategy pi to to
maximize our rewards. Then we have
proximal policy optimization. And this
proximal policy optimization is exactly
what it sounds. We approximate the
optimal policy. Okay. So we basically
take a bunch of workers in in our in our
setting and we put them in parallel to
create new policies or to to evaluate
them and then we take the aggregate of
those. So the average of those to to
actually come up with a stable
inference. And this works just like it
works in random forests, right? So we
have a bunch of different inferences and
when we aggregate them we get the robust
distribution and that's it's basically
the same idea. So that's that's
basically the proximal policy
optimization. Then we have a model based
reinforcement learning and here we
actually first try to create a model
about the world. Okay. So in the
previous examples in the previous
reinforcement learning models we did not
model the world. We just took it as it
comes. Okay. So here we're trying to
narrow down what the world does. So we
have some maybe macroeconomic model or
some interest rate model or whatever it
may be, right? Or capital asset pricing
model and we work within that model to
really make our exploration more
targeted, right? And hopefully the
results a little bit better. And it
tends to be this process tends to be
much more efficient and interpretable
obviously. So we basically explore in a
certain range that's determined by the
our model of the real world.
Then we have distributional
reinforcement learning and what we're
doing here we're accounting for all the
possible values of our actions also the
environmental feedback and this is great
for risk management right where we have
to explore the tales of the distribution
or portfolio management. So this is this
is a very very good model as well. And
then then of course we have asynchronous
actor critic and and this is basically
the same actor critic that we've seen
before when we had the actor critic
critic actor critic critic except here
they're not scheduled. Okay? So in actor
critic critic the actor and the critics
were scheduled they they went
sequentially one after the other. Here
they just kind of go as as they feel
like it. Right? So a bit at random and
so it's it delivers much more optimized
faster environment and and it's very
very scalable as well. So we can we can
scale it across like lots of critics not
just two critics and you know just like
in any traditional asynchronous
programming.
Okay. So that's that's the that's kind
of the fundamentals of the reinforcement
learning and we can compare their
performance.
&gt;&gt; Another question. Are you using regime
detection in your trading algos?
&gt;&gt; You can, right? So you can use regime
detection and that would be I think fall
falling under this model umbrella or it
depends. So you can think about regimes
in different in different ways. So you
can think of regimes as states. Okay. So
you can you can say that this universe
of states that we're modeling it can be
regimes. Okay. Okay. So, we observe
states. These can be different regimes.
And these can be as granular or as as
coarse as you like, right? So, your
regime can be just a two-state regime
where the market is up or the market is
down or it can be like infinitely
granular where it incorporates different
levels of inflation and different levels
of this and different levels of that all
and and each state is described by these
multi-dimensional regimes. Right? So, so
but there has to be some separation
between these states like these states
have to be different. So, implicitly
they're regimelike, right? So, so that's
that's where the regime comes in.
Another way where you can potentially
incorporate regime, I was just looking
at it right here is in model based.
Okay. Okay. So in model based you can
explicitly model like use some regime
modeling methodologies to explicitly
connect them your model to to your
reinforcement learning to operate within
that regime changing model. Yeah. So we
can retrofit it with all the existing
models. And so if we compare the
performance right so actually the model
based reinforcement learning is the most
efficient. Okay. So because we we really
parameterize it, it's it doesn't have to
do as much random searches and as many
random searches and such and there are
different different other metrics that
we can measure it training stability
final performance right so and
implementation complexity so all of
these different models they perform
differently on on different scales and
and we can we can consider all of these
different things right so we can also
look at wall clock right So if DTPG is
our baseline then this actor and and
three critics is actually very efficient
and it's also very scalable and has low
memory usage which is basically makes it
a good model.
So let's go back to buy versus build. So
the first question if if you're deciding
whether you want to buy or build these
agendic models is do you need an agendic
model? Right? If your regime switching
model works just fine, maybe that's a
good place to just stick it out. Right?
So again, new research is showing that
the more of these models come online,
the more noise there is in the system
because they produce noise by
exploration. So it's it just becomes
more and more complicated. If you decide
like so need the agentic model. Let's
say you decide that you do. Okay? Then
you have to assess how capable you are
to build it internally, right? So if
you're less than half capable to build
it, this is this parameter s here, then
you should buy it. Okay? If you're
between somewhere five and 7, maybe you
buy some components and you build the
rest, right?
And if however if you feel like you know
you you're capable of building it maybe
you should assess the scale. So uh what
is your budget whether it's less than 5
million or greater than 5 million. We're
talking about large organizations here
but this is like typical typical budgets
for these kind of projects and whether
you have whe where the these projects
will deliver positive return on
investment. and I'm going to talk about
for the rest of the talk is how do you
actually find out whether the
reinforcement learning model you're
considering delivers a positive ROI. So
if it's if the ROI is negative, I would
highly recommend you don't buy it. Maybe
you wait until the next iteration of
reinforcement learning models. But if
the ROI is positive, then you may want
to consider whether it it's you need it
customized, right? So, and if it's
custom, if you need a custom model, then
you probably would build it. And if you
don't need a custom model, then you
would probably buy it. Okay. So, this is
pretty typical of any large scale
implementation. Again, I do have a paper
on SSRN and I I'll show it to you in a
second and I just uploaded it actually
the latest version. It's it's very
mathematical. Just warning this this
paper that I'm about to show you, it's
not the the easiest paper ever, but it's
right here. And just in case you're
curious, again, it's it's a very very
mathematical version. All right, so
let's move on with how do we determine
this ROI? So, how do we verify what this
AI algorithm does? So, somebody comes up
comes over to you or calls you or you
see somebody at a trade show, it's like,
you know, I have this amazing agent and
it does generates these billions of
dollars. All you have to do is like pay
me $20 a month and I'm exaggerating, but
you know, some some people do that and
you know it just and you're going to
make all this money and there are some
solutions to that and I'm going to talk
briefly about what those solutions are
and I'm and then I'm going to talk about
my solution. So in most cases the
existing solutions they they really kind
of use the kind of trial and error or or
gradient methods to figure out what's
going on. So this is one solution which
is very popular. It's called lime. It's
a really sensitivity analysis. So we
would we would find a kind of a
simplified model to the current model
and potentially get stuck in the local
approximation. All right. And then from
there we would really do this. So you
would have a model and let's say you're
a doctor. Okay. So you would provide it
a list of conditions. So somebody
sneezing, it has a certain weight loss
and a headache, no fatigue, age, you
know, and the model says it's a flu, but
the doctor is like, but why do you know
it's a flu? And so the model is going to
gives you like kind of a localized
explanation. So it shows okay so you
have you have sneezing you have a
headache but no fatigue it must be a flu
and that is designed to give the doctor
confidence that what you're doing
actually makes sense. All right so it's
sort of in think about instead of these
flu characteristics you would give them
a market characteristics. Okay. So,
today gas is absolutely getting
shredded, but we have some other things
going on, right? Crypto is doing one
thing and and and the spy is doing
another thing. And so based on that,
you're arriving at this thing at the
forecast or at the estimate what's going
on. And this kind of gives you
confidence because you actually see the
details. So, this stands for local
interpretable model agnostic
explanations. Okay. So that's what lime
means. And and another way of
understanding what they're doing is
looking at this picture. So if we look
at this original image, then lime gives
you explains this is a lab playing an
electric guitar or an acoustic guitar
rather. Okay. So and why is it playing
an acoustic guitar is because you see a
guitar, you see the yellow outline of
the acoustic and then you see the
Labrador space. And so these individual
components are designed to give a human
observer confidence that what the
explanation actually work because they
can see they can kind of answer the
question why does it work. So there's a
new model too which is called
abbreviated to cleo which is coherent
local explanations for mathematical
optimization and they basically do
gradient kind of method to minimize
different different parameters to figure
out what's what's the right answer is
here and it's another paper you can look
it up it's by by auto at all. So what I
promote is a lot simpler. Okay, so it's
simple. It took me a long time to think
about it. And this can be applied to
anything like you have perishable
inventory. You need to figure out how
much bread you want to buy for your
restaurant or whatever. Financial
portfolio management, you know, you have
to figure out what what kind of wigs you
want to allocate to different assets to
maximize your returns and many other
business problems. So what we're going
to do is we're going to optimize the
loss just like we do in machine learning
or anywhere in any other things and and
loss is the realized total cost or
realized total profit minus predicted
total cost or predicted total profit.
Right? So this is basically the
difference between the realized and
predicted. So here's our loss. So we we
have a realized value and then we made
some decisions based on our expectations
of the real value and this is what we're
going to optimize instead of this y can
be cost times optimal decision policy.
So it's C and optimal decision policy is
pi right. So this is the second line or
it can be the last line on the slide
which is weights of portfolio assets
times returns of these portfolio assets
minus the weights that we determine
based on the expected portfolio returns
times the expected portfolio returns.
Okay. So the right hand side term the
negative term is what we expected and
the w transposed r is what we received.
Okay, so the key result and this is in
the paper is that we can express this
regret which is a difference between
expected and realized as a covariance
between the two variables between the
input variables and the decision. So in
in case of the portfolio management this
would be the weights and the returns.
Okay, so the returns would be kind of
costs and the weights would be the
decisions and for different models we
may have some extra errors. Okay, so
this this relationship between the
regret and coariance holds exactly for
linear models and it holds exactly for
quadratic models like fully
optimization. But for other models, it
will have an error potentially. Okay, so
this is an extra term that we need to
account for due to nonlinearities and
such. And basically this is your just
proof of sketch for linear models. You
know, it's just use coariance formula.
Now it looks very very simple but nobody
has done it until now because it's
completely interdisciplinary. Okay. So
it's this idea of regret has mostly been
studied by computer scientists only
recently made its way in optimization
and it's very very different. So I have
the benefit of hanging around different
areas for long enough that they can
actually aggregate pretty quickly all
the different information and come up
with ideas like this. Okay. So bottom
line is what we're trying to say here is
we can approximate this. We we're
creating this global approximation
to the loss. Okay? And as we acquire
more and more data, our global
approximation works better and better.
And just to don't take my word for it.
So here's here's an an example. We take
synthetic data. We just create random
data and we create random portfolios
using our mean variance optimization and
and just on based on the simulated data.
The blue line is our coariance loss.
Okay. And the orange line is the
realized loss and you can see that
basically our blue line immediately
gives you future regret. Okay. So that
that the orange line converges to over
time. Right? So but like instantaneously
you can approximate regret if you can
measure this coariance between inputs
and outputs into the system. Okay. So
you can take any blackbox system you can
observe its inputs and outputs. You can
feed it some inputs get some outputs
out. You take the coariance of those
inputs and outputs and it's going to
give you an approximate regret. And the
regret is the difference between your
realized profit and expected profit.
Right? So and you what you want you want
the regret to be positive. So you want
your model to always to be biased
positively. You want your realized
profit to be greater than your expected
profit. So you don't want negative
regret because if you have negative
regret, it means for profits anyway for
your realized profit is going to be less
than your expected profit. I mean that's
what you want for costs, right? So if
you're minimizing costs, then you want
your realized cost to be lower than than
expected cost. But anyway, so all you
have to do is feed some data into your
black box, observe the outputs, take the
coariance between the inputs you just
fed into the system and the outputs, and
that gives you your expected regret. It
converges immediately. And here's an
example with real market data. Here we
just take five stocks, you know, nothing
nothing fancy. And you know, these
stocks, they they move all the time.
These are weights. These are B
calibrated based on 60-day rolling
window. But you can see on the right,
this is our expected regret again, the
orange line. And and this is our
expected loss versus predicted loss or
expected profit versus predicted profit.
And as you can see, when we're dealing
with highly non-stationary data, our
predicted loss is is is kind of
variable. It doesn't stay perfectly
stationary, but it's a lot less variable
than actual realized loss. Okay. So so
we again we're getting a near-perfect
estimate from the beginning. you don't
you can immediately evaluate how the
model is performing based on observing
coariance between the inputs and outputs
and we can do the same for just any kind
of linear optimization problem. So this
is a simulation with just a simple
random completely random linear
optimization problem. It doesn't do so
well for integer programming. Right? So
here the error is quite large. Again
it's because it's it it's case by case
dependent. Okay? for linear programming
and for for quadratic models. It works
extremely well and this is my very
latest research. So where the circle is
this I I've been working to see if it
works for these reinforcement learning
algorithms and it does. Okay. So here's
a case with DDPG and the blue line is
the actor loss and the critical loss and
and this is the predicted coariance loss
which basically means that the total
loss of the input and output is is is
very close to zero right and it's
basically indicates a good model. So you
can do this on any kind of model if
you're considering to buy or if you're
validating your own model, right? Let's
say you're in a validation group or
you're an executive and somebody brings
you a model that they want to trade. You
know, before you get into all the
nitty-gritty and spend time and energy
understanding how this model works and
rack your brain over what can go wrong.
All you need to do is plug put the some
inputs through the model get the outputs
measure the coariance between inputs and
outputs and it's going to give you the
expected regret. Okay. So, and if the
regret is huge, you know, something is
off. I mean, if it's huge the positive
way, you know, if the expected profit is
much greater than or greater than than
the realized profit, then it's fine,
right? You don't have to say anything.
But if your realized profit is way below
your expected profit, I mean this this
is like you can just scratch it off.
Okay. So, so that's saves you a lot of
time. It saves you a lot of effort. Our
optimal coariance of course is zero
because what we want to build in these
agentic systems is precision. We want
these agentic systems, these robots or
bots to work without any our support and
completely independently figure out the
best possible plan of action. Okay. So
there's we want them to have zero loss.
We want them to respond the environment
exactly. Right? So we want this
coariance of zero and and in some cases
it's feasible in some cases is not
because it depends on the model
construction. But this is this is
basically our target. Okay. So, I hope
you enjoyed the presentation and learned
quite a bit about these reinforcement
learning models and bots. I'm happy to
take any questions or if you prefer, you
can email me. I'm just
ireneldridge@gmail.com
or you can connect with me on LinkedIn
and we can connect that way. But I'll
I'll be happy to discuss it in more
detail. And please take a look at my
paper and I appreciate it very much.
Thank you so much for the invitation. We
did have one question from earlier that
was how do you compete with hedge funds
and other investment traders on a
shoestring budget.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So you can build this stuff on a
shoestring budget. Okay. So the good
news is we have a lot of tools today
that are available that were not
available 10 years ago. All right.
[clears throat] So we have lots of free
data. Number one. Number two, like
Google Collab, which is basically a
cloud-based program program execution
system. It is free, right? And it has
advanced computing power built in.
And and if if if it's not completely
free, you know, it's it's very very low
cost. Like I'm talking about $20 a
month. So you can execute really robust
systems online.
So you can get data online, you can
execute these systems online, you know,
there's there's just lots and lots of
opportunity to to do these things if and
but you need to obviously invest time
and money into educating yourself about
how to do that. So so that's that's I
would say knowledge is the greatest
barrier here because these models are
increasingly complex, much more complex
than they used to be. I am teaching at
the Cornell Financial Engineering
Program and and now John Hopkins. So,
you know, you're always welcome to join
me, but I'm happy to I'm happy to answer
questions again by email or LinkedIn as
well.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. There was a followup
question. Shouldn't there be some slight
penalty even if regret is positive?
I.e., wouldn't you want your model of
expectations to be consistent with the
observed results?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I think so. So again, it all
depends on your exact objective. So
you're right. So in principle, we do
want these agents to work exactly. So we
want them to to be trained to the point
where whatever they observe, they
they're immediately able to come up with
they basically would have a policy is
kind of a set of prescribed actions,
right? And depending on the given
situation over time, they learn the
environment so well that they're able to
to to do what's optimal every single
time, right? But in in many cases, and
it's due to non-stationerity in the
environment or whatever, right? This
this may not be feasible. So if it's not
feasible to be perfectly on target, at
least you want to do better, right, than
worse. So if you have a bias in your
regret, you want your regret to be
biased the right way. That's
advantageous to you. So that's that's
all that's all I was trying to say.
&gt;&gt; And another person asked, "What books do
you recommend?"
&gt;&gt; Okay. So what books? There's actually a
great free book. It's called by Barto
and Sauten. Uh that's available online
for free that's on reinforcement
learning. Okay. So I have a new book
coming out. It's kind of still in
stealth mode, so I can't really
advertise it. So, all of these are
definitely great books. Let me just look
up this Barto and Sutton book. This is a
Stanford book. This one is an
introduction, okay? So, it's not a super
detailed like the book I'm finishing up
is is going to be very very detailed and
technical and and etc. This is a
Stanford based book and it's very very
interesting, I think. Thank you so much
for the incredible presentation and
thank you so much.
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.
