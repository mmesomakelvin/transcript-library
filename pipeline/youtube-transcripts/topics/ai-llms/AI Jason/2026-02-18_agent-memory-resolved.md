So one of the key limitation factor for
cloud code or any coding agent is a
context management. If you use coding
agent enough you will you often notice
is that agent just seem to became dumper
as it works longer and more complex
tasks. You'll make same mistake and made
also forget about some stuff that it
tried before. If fundamentally it is
limited by the context window of learn
model. Even though modern model can take
around 1 million token, the actual
effective context window is somewhere
between 120 to 200k. That's where all
the coding agent today is designing this
conversation compacting mechanism around
those optimal contact window
limitations. But ideally, you want agent
to be able to remember every single
trace it did before. And even though
cloud code introduced this memory
feature recently where agent can log
information into its shared memory file
of the project, but fundamentally the
way it work is still somewhat limited.
It is basically keeping a separate
memory MD file for every single pure. So
if your project is actually pretty
complicated, this document can blow up
very quickly as well. And also this is
very specific to cloud code. In an ideal
world, you want those knowledge and
memory shared across any possible agent
sessions no matter which agent it is
accessed to. Only by doing that your
team's knowledge is actually
accumulating and agent is getting better
the more you use it. But this is a hard
problem. Many team attempt to solve this
but haven't got a ideal solution yet. I
found this project called one context
that is released this week where they
are utilizing this method called get
context controller that is defining a
specific memory framework that is
extremely simple and basic. So the agent
is managing the context just like git
and this memory is persist across any
session and any coding agent. It can
even be shared with your open cloud as a
memory file where you can chat to in
slack or telegram and with this method
they found cloud code is performing 13%
better on software engineer tasks and
even enable some cheaper and smaller
model like gr 4.5 air to perform at
similar level as frontier models and
most interesting part is that this setup
is extremely simple and basic something
you can literally set up now and this is
what I want to share today I'll take you
through how does one context actually
work the idea methodology behind it and
how you can start using it. But before I
dive into that, I know many of you are
first-time vibe coder and when you're
just getting started, I know things can
be pretty hard and the best way to learn
is by doing and practicing real
purchase. That's why I want to introduce
you to this awesome free resource from
the hustle where they did a whole bunch
of research and come up with 20 AI app
ideas you can start building and
practicing. They did a whole bunch of
research on Reddit and Twitter to find
real pain points that people have been
asking and specifically those ideas are
easy to start and execute. something you
can just spend a weekend to build,
deploy and launch to the market. And for
each idea, it also give you step-by-step
breakdown and prompts for generating
prompt specs to get cloud code or cursor
to start implementing. Blue should give
you a good sense about how to write good
prompt and specs for coding agents. And
they even give you some ideas about what
you should do to start generating your
first revenue. And those app ideas
across both consumer and business
facing. They even link to a big database
of all side hustle that you can start
practicing. So if you're looking to
actually chipping something real and
honing your AI coding capabilities with
cloud code or cursor, I highly recommend
you go check out this resource. I put a
link in the description below for you to
download for free and thanks Hopspot for
sponsoring this content. Now let's get
back how does one context works. So at
its core the get context controller is a
basically defined rules or skill that
agent can follow to maintain a list of
memory file that is saving all the
actions and learnings agent had at
different level. It has this four main
files. One is main.md which is storing
the global context of the project that
you are executing. Then they also
introduce this branch idea to log
different approach paths and tasks that
agent is ever worked on. And for each
task and branch it has this three files.
One is commit.m MD. There's high level
milestones the agent has hit like after
every time it finish a subtask or
deliver a meaningful piece of work it
will log commit MD file just like how we
normal do get commit and then the log.md
is where it will store the full row
conversation history. This is what they
refer to otaa observation sort actions
and if you're using cloud corax is
basically the row conversation message
as well as metadata. That is storing the
metadata of the project. Then again give
high level information for agent to find
specific piece of knowledge. So this
structure provide foundations of how the
memory is stored for particularly
longunning tasks and they have four
different actions that agent can take.
One is branch they should be triggered
when agent decide to exploit alternative
strategy and second is commit. This is
what agent do when they hit certain
milestones or completes certain subtasks
and merge. This will be triggered when
agent complete certain task or
exploration and want to merge this
history of exploration by certain branch
and this is quite important because for
complex longunning task this branch
commit merge methods allow agent to fork
conversation very easily without losing
the overall context and this might be
abstract let's take you through a actual
example so you might have this task for
agent to build a web scraper for
LinkedIn and with this methods agent
will firstly try to set up a main. MD
that is logging the global road map. It
can be just a folder in your ripple.
Then it will start deciding a method or
approach like it might decide to build a
playright script first as a direction.
This where it will create a branch
playright. And what does this branch
action actually means? It's just
creating a folder called playright under
the branch folder and start initialize
commit.md file blog.md file which should
automatically retrieve and save all the
conversation history and then the
metadata. So it set up foundation about
how do we track memory and knowledge of
this specific playright script based
approach and as agent works along this
approach it might hit some milestones
like got a v1 script finished and tested
and that's where it will commit a memory
and what this commit action does is
basically instruct agent to update
commit.md file to log a summary of what
it did and also has option to revise the
maind file and the benefit of this is
that you basically start having this log
and source of truth of actions that
agent is taking and after finish it can
run this merge command and what this
merge command do is that it will try to
merge the commit.md file into the main
one and combine the log.md file as well
as update the min.md file to provide a
highle summary. So this is like a basic
flow of how agent should maintain the
memory in this structure and it can be
much more complicated and flexible. For
example, agent might find this approach
of playright script is not correct.
Instead, it should use API instead. Then
it can create a branch for API
exploration and maintain all the
learnings around that approach in that
specific branch folder. And the
interesting part is that once we set up
the file structure like that agent is
also able to retrieve information
progressively. If later we ask it, hey,
help me understand where we are at in
terms of this LinkedIn scrap per
project, you can firstly look at the
M.MD MD file to understand the overall
project scope and what kind of
exploration it has been done. And if you
decide to dive deeper, it can fetch a
specific branch information. Looking at
the commit file to see for the playright
approach, what are all the different
commits and milestone we ever hit and if
there anything interesting, it can also
dive into the row conversation history
of a specific commit by looking at the
log.md file. So this is a whole setup.
It's basically this four commands plus a
file structure that is maintaining
agents learning and allow cloud code to
achieve a 14% more performance by just
logging and feeding relevant actions
that agent is taking along the way. And
just later this week, let also introduce
this context repositories feature which
is very similar concept of what we just
talked about here except it is
maintaining a different structure of
memory but overall approach is very
similar using file system to create
multiple different levels of
information. So any coding agent can
access memory and information
progressively. And the most interesting
thing is that it works across any
sessions and any coding agent. That
means for any project we can spin up
multiple different agents working on
different things. And they all share the
same context and memory in real time
about what the other is doing so that
they can make decisions better. and the
author of Git context controller
basically introduced this tool called
one context that's capsulating the
overall methods that he just showed in
the paper into command line tool they
can run here and share context across
different agent sessions and this is
what I want to show you how it works and
meanwhile if you're interested in agent
memory and context management we have a
few workshop in AI builder club where we
share practical tips and learnings of
how to best set up your coding agent
memory MD file as well as tricks for
building production agents alongside
size step-by-step tutorial for how to
set things up. So, if you're interested,
you can click on the link below to join.
Now, let's set up one context together.
So, firstly, you do npmi-g
one context- ai. This will install one
context on your computer. Then you
simply run one context. This will open
up view like this, which will give you a
split view. On the left is agent session
and on the right side is the actual
agent. So, the first thing you will do
is that you will want to add context. So
for context you can consider as a kind
of group of information that you can
share with others later. So I can click
add context and here I can give a name
and it could be anything to be honest.
Each context is considered as a group
memory later they will allow you to
share this group of memory with others
but easiest way could be for each
project you can set up one memory. So
let's say I call a demo project and then
we can start adding a new session to
this context. So I can select a coding
agent. It can be cloud or codeex and
then I can choose the workspace. Click
create. Now here it open a new session
on the right side. So if I ask it
information like what's my name? It
wouldn't know this information but you
can see here after finish it is showing
that it's running this stop hook. And on
the left side you will see this session
already generate a quick summary called
username inquiry and identification. And
if I hover this context already have
some highle summary. And now let's test
again. In here I tell it my name is
JSON. Okay. So name has been remembered
even though here it ran memory which is
using cloud codes own memory and we
don't want that. So I'm going to tell it
remove that from memory. We don't need
it. Okay. So now we're making sure it is
not part of memory. And just to double
confirm that I'm going to open docloud
folder and I can see in that specific
project folder the memory is empty. And
now I can create a new session. And this
time I will even try something new. I'm
going to add a new folder called new one
context demo. And I will ask it what is
my name using one context. And you can
see it is start running command line
align search. Align is a company behind
one context. And it is basically doing
the search in memory and return back
information. My name is Jason. So you
can see it is totally across different
folders but it is still able to share
same information. And what's really cool
about this one you can imagine is you
can use the same mechanism and getting
agent explore totally different
directions but still share the same
memory about what's going on. And to
understand how this information actually
saved if you're using one context you
can do code align which will open this
folder. It has this skill file which
including context for agent about how to
use it and it has very specific context
here that it will firstly do a board
search to search a specific query within
that context folder but then they can
also narrow down scope by passing dash s
which is a specific session information
or a specific turn and if they really
want it can also dive deeper to do
search on a specific turn to look into
the actual conversation of a specific
session and all that knowledge is saved
locally on your DB folder here called
line. DB, but it's basically replicating
your actual cloud code conversation
history as well as a summary
information. And the way it works is
that every time you add a new session
here, this session will be logged and
captured by a watcher service and
automatically has a stop hook. And the
stop hook will run to save that new
conversation information into the DB
here as well as triggering a large model
call which default is using GPT4 mini to
generate summary of the information and
to just demonstrate a real world use
case. Let me add a new context to be
memory research. And here I can set up
two sessions and open another session
with codecs. And I'm going to ask it to
research about different memory setups.
So here I'll ask it help me investigate
and learn how does open claw memory
mechanism work and while it is working
for the cloud code session I'm going to
ask help me research and investigate how
does let us context repositories work
and I might add another session here to
say help me research how does one
context memory mechanism works okay so
now each session finishes research one
for the one context memory mechanism one
for let us context repository and
another is for the Open claw memory
setup. Now let me add a new session. And
now I'm going to tell you it reminds me
how different agent memory setup works
across open claw letter one context from
our past exploration. Don't use internet
just from our own memory and give me a
breakdown of pros and cons. Now you can
see what happened is that it will
firstly search for relevant sessions.
Firstly try to search the memory which
will return list of relevant sessions
within the project. And each session
basically means the title and the
description that we have here. Then it
start looking deeper each session and
each turn. In the end it return me each
methods and its porns and corns and in
the end a summary comparison. Even
though it does seem make some mistakes
the open call somehow it says it do
claw/per/memory
which is not exactly true. Let me check
if it's because we researched wrong
thing. Oh no. Okay. It looks like
there's something wrong about retrieval
probably because cloud code also has its
own memory. But I'm sure this can be
improved. What's really cool is that you
can see this very effective way for
agent to retrieve that and look at what
has been done collectively not just one
session but across all the sessions and
if you have teams works together this
became a really good tool since all of
you can contribute to the same knowledge
graph. And they actually have this share
button as well. So I can click on that.
It will ask me to confirm but once
confirm it will return me a link which I
can copy the link. This basically create
this URL where people can talk to this
is like simple chatbot but loaded with
the conversation context that we had
here. So I can ask here how does let us
contact memory works. It will do the
same thing search across different
sessions and retrieve information and
then it will return back this uh summary
learning which looks correct. Obviously
it's like whole interface very bad but
it help you understand how did this
memory system works but the core thing
you just need to remember here is that
fundamentally the way it works is a file
system to store and summarize abstract
all the past actions which you can
easily set up and achieve your own skill
for your cloud code and save their
memory locally and if you're interested
I can show you a setup I personally have
next time that's it I hope you enjoy
this video thank you and I see you next
