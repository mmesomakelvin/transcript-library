So, Open AI just released this
open-source repo called Symphony. On the
surface level, it looks like a
orchestrator that allow you to manage
coding agents through ticket tracker
like linear, but it is a lot more than
just connecting linear. It's a totally
different way of interacting with
agents. So, the way we use coding agent
has shifted a lot for the past few
months. From initially just the
auto-complete to primarily interactive
session with coding agent to now most of
us around two or three different
sessions in parallel, each working
isolated work tree for different
features or bug fixing. And then new
tooling like Super set or conductor that
has been introduced to help you run and
manage different interactive coding
sessions easier. The problem is that
even with those tools, many people,
including myself, will feel this burden
when we are working on more than like
three different sessions cuz we just
can't context switch every minute. And I
personally have had multiple times
sending the wrong instruction to the
wrong thread. So, ceiling of how much we
can get out from those coding agent is
no longer the model capability, but our
own attention and cognitive load. And
the recent project Symphony is so
interesting is that Open AI's
engineering team had this realization
that the current experience has been
orienting around coding session, merge
PRs, but in reality for the past
decades, software workflow are largely
organized around deliverables, things
like issues, tasks, tickets, milestones.
Engineer leaders have been managing
massive amount of tasks across thousands
of workers, not by reviewing everyone's
PR, but looking at final outcomes using
tools like linear and Atlassian. And
Open AI's proposed solution is move
human up a level. Instead of managing
two three interactive sessions, you
manage tickets. The agent works at
ticket level, report back through the
ticket itself, and you stay in the loop
without monitoring individual sessions.
The ticket tracker becomes state machine
itself. And the way Symphony makes this
work is almost embarrassingly simple,
but very effective. It's a background
process. You run it once, point to a
workflow file, which we'll talk a bit
more, and then it runs forever. Every 30
seconds, this background process will
glance through your linear board. If it
finds any ticket in to-do slots, it will
set up an isolated workspace and start
agent in that workspace. And the whole
system has three key components. One is
the scheduler, the background process
that is pulling ticket data and set up
workspace, manage session life cycle,
and a workflow.md file that lives inside
your repo. It contains configuration of
scheduler and detailed instruction for
coding agent to know how to work with
those ticketing system. And those
external system like linear is a durable
state machine for human to interact with
agent. And this whole setup is actually
very flexible. You don't have to use
linear. You don't have to use Code X.
You can actually customize to whatever
you want. But overall implementation
concept is what's interesting. And the
most interesting part is this
workflow.md file. It basically break
down into two parts. The top part is the
YAML front matter. It configures
scheduler directly, like which linear
project it is, what type of ticket it
should pick up, where should agent
create isolated workspace, and even
programmatic hooks to run after it set
up the workspace. And this is very
useful, so you no longer need to rely on
agent to set those things up. As well as
how many agents can be run in parallel
and specific agent settings. And after
that, the bottom half is a markdown
file. This is the prompt agent every
single turn details rendered in. It's a
standard operating procedure for
handling tickets in this repo. How
should agent plan task? How should agent
go validate its work? And what would be
considered as done? And when should
outreach for human review? And what I
love about this design is that the same
file just live inside your repo, so it's
version controlled and can be changed
through normal pull request. And the
file itself contains some programmatic
rule that controls scheduler and also
what an agent does. There's no separate
config service, no admin panel, no UI at
all. And the team only code base on this
workflow. So, when you onboard a new
agent capability of adding new step in
the process, you just very easily change
this markdown file, and the rest will
just follow. And this whole system is
designed very flexible. You don't have
to use Code X, and you don't have to use
linear. They have one example
implementation in Elixir, which is a
programming language. But they have this
spec.md file that's detailing how this
framework or system is designed. So, you
can just drop this file to any coding
agent and ask it to build and design a
system in any programming language.
There are already a lot of different
community attempts. Like someone
building custom TUI based on the task
data. And also another person already
rebuilt it to support Cloud Code as
agent harness. And I'm going to show you
step by step how you can set these
things up. But orchestrating agent is
only part of the work. As Open AI
mentioned, this whole thing only works
if your coding agent's environment is
set up properly in a way that it can
complete tickets end-to-end atomically,
which you can call it harness engineer,
but fundamentally just whether your
environment or code base has been set up
in the right way, so agent has
everything it needs to complete task
end-to-end. And typical things like is
the system bootable, so agent can just
run a script to get everything set up
without spending time to figure that
part out. And does the system has a
proper documentation structure for
different things. And I think most
people does have these two things
properly set up in your code.md or
agent.md file. But the part I think most
of team didn't set up is those
self-verifying tools. They allow agent
to do an end-to-end test after
implementing something. And even submit
a video recording to prove that it have
tested and it's working in the ticket
directly just like in their demo. But in
the doc, they didn't really mention how
they were handling this part. So, I did
some research across many major skills.
And the best one I found is this
Playwright CRI tool. So, I believe many
of us are pretty familiar with
Playwright MCP, which allow agent to use
the browser and do a task, check the
logs. But the problem before was that
Playwright with MCP setup, it took a
huge amount of tokens in context window
even when it's not needed. But they have
released this Playwright CRI tool
alongside agent skill that detailing
every single comment. And the most
interesting comment is this video
recording CRI. So, Playwright allow
agent to run commands like video start
and video stop to capture browser
session into a MP4 or WebM video. They
even have some pretty advanced video
rendering capability where they can add
different chapter on the screen. Like
here's one example video where it can
record its own session and even add new
HTML element on top of the screen to
annotate the action the agent took. And
then upload session into linear, so you
can very easily verify if things
actually work. And as far as I know,
other tools like Chrome DevTools MCP or
agent browser don't have this video
capability out of box. So, this is one
very important skill that will make your
whole experience complete. And
meanwhile, there are also other skills
that you should add. And I just take one
of the repo I have as example. We have
this Playwright CRI tool that has a
skill as well as a list of reference for
agent to know how to like record a video
and tracing the debug logs. And we also
have a skill here to tell agent how to
start server locally. And because ours
is pretty straightforward, so it's just
a skill file. But sometimes for more
complicated things, you can create
predefined script as well. So, agent no
longer spends cognitive power on those
type of stuff. And meanwhile, I also
created this linear skill that allow
agent to know how to operate linear
tickets by using linear API as well as
things like upload video evidence of the
test. And we actually have more
documentations about different parts of
system. And in the agent.md or cloud.md
file, this is where we have a proper
index of different documentation
systems, so you can always go and find
the relevant information. We also give
more detailed debugging skills. For
example, we use Grafana to track and
store all the logging in production. And
we add a relevant Grafana log skill in
our repo, so the agent can fetch real
production logs for bug fixing. And all
those things are try to serve one
purpose, which is setting up your code
base so that your agent can fix bug,
building new features, verify things are
working fully atomically end-to-end. I
put all skills inside AI Build Club, so
you can copy-paste and ask your agent to
customize for your own code base. I put
the link in the description below, so
you can join and access. And once you
set this up, even though you don't use
Symphony, they're still going to be
really useful. But after that, this is
where we can start setting up the
Symphony, connect to linear, as well as
this workflow.md file. So, once you
clone the Symphony repo, you'll see
folder like this. You'll have this
folder of Elixir. So, this is one
version implementing Elixir programming
language from Open AI. And most of the
time, you can just use this Elixir
directly. But if you want to customize
it to like connect not linear, but
connect to Trello or Jira, you can ask
coding agent to customize it or even
building a different language by
pointing to spec.md file. And here's
basically what I did in Python folder. I
just point to spec.md file and ask it to
build a new version in Python. But most
of the time, you actually don't need to
do that. You can just reuse what Open AI
provided. And firstly, you can confirm
whether the script is So, you can run
script by doing this, which point to the
Symphony program that has been built.
And run help. So, this should show you
the actual command about how to run
Symphony. You basically just do Symphony
and point to a path to workflow.md file.
And by default, you can't just run the
Symphony like this. You can run this to
bind Symphony command to the specific
path. So, just run this. And then you
can do Symphony, point to a specific
workflow.md file. And by default, it
will give you this warning. Then you can
add this argument to the command, which
will set our Symphony background process
like this. It will track all the tasks,
show you the project, and next refresh
time. It will track a specific linear
project you set up every 30 seconds. If
there any ticket in to-do, it will pick
up and show up in this list. And all
those configurations are actually
defined in workflow.md file. So, in
workflow.md file, at the front matter,
there is a project slug. And Symphony
script will basically read that
metadata,
importing information from a specific
project. Same thing for all the other
configurations, like how frequently it
should pull the ticket data, what are
things it should do after setting up a
new workspace, how many agent can be run
at the same time, and the Code X
configuration. But once you set up this,
it's basically monitoring the specific
Symphony repo with Elixir
implementation. What we want to do is
apply this to your own workspace. It's
actually pretty straightforward. You can
just open any coding agent like Code X
or Cloud Code, point to the spec.md file
and say, "I want to set up Symphony for
my repo, and we will reuse the Elixir
implementation here, and help me build
the workflow.md file for my repo." With
just one command, coding agent is smart
enough to look at your own repo and
design a workflow.md file inside there.
And this is the one it created for me,
including the project slug and API key
and all the other configurations. But
you do need to set up linear first. If
you haven't created linear account yet,
just go create a one and then add a new
project. And in this project, click on
the button here, you can just paste into
your coding agent. This thing in the
middle here is a project slot, or you
can manually paste into the workflow.md
file as well. And meanwhile, you need to
get a linear API key, which you can get
by clicking on settings, security and
access, and add a new personal API key
here. And once you did that, you should
run this command, which will save the
linear API key globally on your
computer. So, every time when agent try
to use linear, it can access any
projects you have access to. And there
are some configuration you should do,
which is status. So, Symphony out-of-box
are designed for some specials status
control flow, like human review status
and also merging status. Once you put a
ticket into do, Symphony will
automatically pick up and put that in
progress and trigger an agent session.
And once agent finish the work, it will
change to human review status, so that
you can review the work. And once
finished, you can set the status to be
merging, which will trigger the agent
automatically raise a PR from this work.
And once you did all that, you can do
run Symphony past through your
workflow.md file, plus this I understand
that this will be running without the
usual guardrail comment. And now
Symphony will be working and picking up
all the tickets in your project here. To
make it easier, you can also create a
new view, set up this board, so that you
get this kind of Kanban experience. But
to just test, I can just create ticket
change the landing page hero copy from
your company on autopilot to your AI
growth team, and the set up the status
to be to do. And this should trigger our
agent here. If I go back here, you can
see this time it pick up this ticket,
and then you can see the agent session
show up, and then last agent message
here. And depends on your settings, you
can also go check this workspace. You
can see inside this workspace, it has
one workspace per ticket. So, each one
is running isolated environment. And
this example implementation also has uh
kind of web UI dashboard that you can
visit, and this will list out similar
information you will see in terminal
here. Not particularly useful, but I
just thought I'd mention this. And you
can see after a while, this agent
changes ticket to in progress status,
which reflect in our linear board as
well. And if I click on that, agent made
a plan and logged all the steps it did.
After a few minutes, the agent check off
every single items on the checklist, and
upload a video recording to verify
things are working. And as a human, I
can just very easily see if things are
working or not. And once I mark
something as merging, it will also
create a PR for me. So, this is a whole
end-to-end process and how you set
things up. It definitely feels like
future. If you hit any blockers, I have
more detailed step-by-step breakdown, as
well as all skills posted in the AI
Build Club. Every week, we have workshop
to go through those latest learnings and
answer any questions. So, if you're
