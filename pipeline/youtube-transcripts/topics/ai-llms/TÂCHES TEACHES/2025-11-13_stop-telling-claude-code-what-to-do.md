Hello and welcome back to another
episode of Tash Teaches. I'm Tash and in
today's video I want to talk about
something that has massively increased
the effectiveness of my Claude code
usage that we could call metarrompting.
A lot of people who have come to Claude
code have arrived here from using more
kind of ignorant I would say childlike
approaches to AI assisted coding with
platforms like Vzero or Lovable and the
whole vibe coding concept while lovely
in theory of just saying do this do that
make it this works to some extent but
you'll notice that a lot of the time the
things that you want don't actually get
implemented properly or they break or
they can't be effectively tested and you
end up having to give 20 30 individual
prompts to try and solve the singular
problem or add the singular feature that
you wanted to in the first place. So in
order to explain this I want to bring
your uh focus to this particular prompt
that I tend to run anytime that I want
to do anything of some substance. If I'm
just trying to change the background of
something from yellow to red, sure, I
could do that myself. Go in and adjust
the CSS of whatever it is that I'm
building. Or I could just say make the
background yellow, and that would work
fine. But most of the time, I'm doing
more complex things than that. Things
that require multiple stages of changes
across multiple files and analysis of
certain things, and then ideally
verification and testing to prove that
what I did was right. So, I have this
prompt that I call create prompt. The
reason why we're talking meta prompting
here is very rarely do I tell Claude
what I want it to do and get it to go do
it because most of the time there's
assumptions that it will have or
misalignments with my goals that mean
that by me just saying what I want, it's
not the clearest way for Claude to
understand the instructions that I'm
giving it. So, I've folded this up here
because it's a pretty long prompt that I
run. But this create prompt is a prompt
engineer. We're going to go through this
section by section and then I'm going to
show you in practice how this might be
useful. So, what I would usually do, let
me just whip this up so I could show you
is let's say I open up a new instance of
Claude. Say I want to do a thing.
Instead of saying I want to create a
dashboard blah blah blah blah blah, what
I would first do is do create prompt and
then I tend to use my uh transcription
tool. So I would say I want to create a
dashboard utilizing blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah. For some reason my
uh transcription tool isn't working. But
the point is it's going to then run this
prompt. You are an expert prompt
engineer for Claude Code specializing in
crafting optimal prompts using XML tag
structuring and best practices. Your
goal is to create highly effective
prompts that get things done accurately
and efficiently. So the first stage is
the user request. The user wants you to
create a prompt for arguments. And this
is whatever comes after this. If I do
create prompt and I say blah blah blah
blah blah blah, this right here is going
to be passed through as an argument to
this custom slash command. So the first
thing it reads is it knows what it is.
It knows what I want to do. Then we have
this core process here. So I've broken
this down that first it uses thinking in
these thinking tags here to analyze what
my request is. So clarity check first
and foremost is it works out whether or
not what I'm asking is clear enough. A
lot of the time it is because usually
I'll just put my transcript on and I'll
say exactly what it is that I want to
do. I'll really wax poetic there. But if
there is not enough context, what it's
going to do is let's scroll down a
little bit here is it's going to ask for
clarification. We'll skip back up again
in a sec. But what happens in that first
step is if it feels that there's not
enough details, it's going to go ahead
and ask me some questions. So, it's
going to ask specific questions about
the ambiguous aspects of my prompt. Blah
blah blah blah blah. As I said, most of
the time I'm giving it enough detail up
front that it doesn't need to do that.
But if I just said build a dashboard,
it's going to want more information. So
let's scroll back up here again for a
sec because you can see that this whole
thinking tag thing, it works out is this
a single file clear goal or is it
complex with multi files? Also, should
this be broken down into one or multiple
prompts? And if they are multiple
prompts, could it be parallelized? is
the tasks that I'm asking for, could
they be run side by side if they're
referencing different parts of the
codebase and actually wouldn't be
editing separate things or relying on
previous steps to have been completed.
So, it's going to work out is it one
prompt, is it multiple, and if it's
multiple, should they be done
sequentially or in parallel? Then, it's
going to figure that out. Then, it's
going to look for how much reasoning it
needs. Does it need to really think
through any stages before doing that?
Does it need to examine the codebase
structure, the dependencies or existing
patterns? Should it be a concise prompt
or comprehensive on the task? What file
references, bash commands, or MCP
servers might be needed? And then
verification. Does this task warrant
built-in error checking or validation
steps? Then it's going to figure that
out and move on to the next stage, which
as I said, interaction flow here is if
it has clarification, it doesn't need
that. It then goes on to confirm that it
has figured out what it wants and it's
going to say this is a complex prompt.
Would you like me to continue? I could
then give it a little bit more context
if I need to. Most of the time I just
say yes. And what it's going to do is
it's going to then generate that prompt
and save it to a folder that if doesn't
already exist in the directory I'm in.
It creates called prompts. And then it
creates the name and the number.
Multiple prompts. It does the same
thing, but it does 001 blah blah blah
002 yada yada yada. How does it actually
create this prompt then? So, let's close
this up. The prompt construction rules.
Um, Anthropic themselves recommend when
using clawed code to structure your
prompts with XML tags, which are
effectively anytime you've seen
something like this uh where it's inside
of this this little bracket, you could
add in your objective. And then having
this closing bracket means that Claude
can then pass that logic in a way that
makes much more sense to it because it's
breaking up this task into sections. So
what is the objective? What is the
context that's needed? What are the
requirements, the constraints? And
finally, what would the output be? So
it's going to figure out all of these
things and it's going to also put at the
bottom very importantly success
criteria. So if we were to have achieved
the object of the objective using said
context and fitting into these
requirements and constraints with an
output like this, how would we define
the success and also how would we verify
that we had achieved this? So this is
very important. Also conditionally
include these are all based off of
anthropics documentation. Uh but we'll
just skip through these. Sometimes if
something does need extended reasoning,
it's going to add in words like
thoroughly analyze or deeply consider.
And this is going to trigger extended
thinking. Most of the time for me that
triggers the sequential thinking MCP.
Also, go beyond basics language. When
I'm saying to create like a a UI for
something or a dashboard, a lot of the
time Claude will do the bare minimum and
it won't look great unless for fun for
for fun some funny reason. If you tell
it to like impress you, go wild, you
know, go beyond basics, it will actually
stretch and do a little bit more.
Particularly with the ability of Sonnet
4.5 to do some really pretty longunning
tasks without any interference.
Also, why is it necessary to tell us why
something must be done? Also, will it
need to call tools in parallel? Uh,
we've got a bunch more stuff here, yada
yada yada. I'm going to be uploading the
this prompt um to uh GitHub so that you
can use this yourself, but it's going to
add in some of these conditional in
inclusions that might or might not be
helpful. Also, then output format. Same
thing down here. It's going to follow
the same approach every single time,
adding one to the number. So great,
these are the prompt construction rules.
Then prompt patterns. So I've got a few
in here. If it's a coding task, here's a
little example. Claudes do recommend or
anthropics documentations do recommend
examples. So if you give something an
example of how you would like the output
to be, it's more likely to do a good job
doing it. So here we go. If it's a
coding task, it's usually going to have
the objective, the context, the
requirements, implementation, output,
verification, and success criteria.
Maybe if it's an analysis task, it's
going to look at these kind of things.
So the objectives, what files would need
to be references, what are the
requirements for set analysis? Output
and again validation to make sure that
that analysis is complete. Research,
same kind of thing. What is the scope of
the research? What do we need as
deliverables for the research?
Evaluation criteria on working out the
quality of the research. Let's close
this up. Uh where are we?
No prompt patterns. There we go. Then
the intelligence rules. So here are some
important things as well. is that
clarity first. If anything is unclear,
you must ask the user before pro
proceeding. A few clarifying questions
save time. Would a colleague with
minimal context understand this prompt?
Context is critical. You always include
why the task matters, who it's for, and
what it will be used for in generated
prompts. Again, this is super key for
telling Claude why it's doing it, who
it's for, and what it will be.
Therefore, it's not just giving it a
task, but it's giving it context around
why this task must be completed. Also be
explicit. Again, we need to be super
clear about exactly what format is
needed for this. What files must be
created and what must they look like?
Scope assessment. Again, simple tasks
don't need massive prompts. Complex
tasks are going to need really long
prompts. Context loading only requests
file reading as an actual tool call if
the task explicitly requires
understanding existing code or
documentation. So again, it's going to
put things in there. Precision versus
brevity. Default to precision. It's okay
to write a long and clear prompt. It
beats a short and ambiguous one. Also,
tool integrations. If there are any MCP
servers that I have and it has access
to, or bash commands, file references,
it needs to mention which ones to use.
Output clarity. Again, every prompt must
specify exactly where to save its
outputs using relative paths. Every
prompt should include clear success
criteria and verification steps. This is
so so helpful. Sometimes, you know, we
we ask it to do a thing, but there's no
way that in in the way that it actually
implements our decision without using
meta prompting that it thinks through,
okay, after I've done this, how can I
verify that it's worked? And then also
after saving the prompt, present this
decision tree to the user. It says, um,
if you've created one prompt, I've saved
it here. Would you like to one, run the
prompt now, two, review and edit it,
three, save it for later, blah blah blah
blah blah. If I choose option one, it
invokes the next slash command, which is
run prompt up here, which we'll have a
look at in a sec. Um, if it's parallel,
it will say, would you like me to run
them in parallel, and it's going to
launch three sub aents working on this
with their own context window um
simultaneously. And similarly, if it's
sequential, it will do them one after
the other. So, let's just fold this up
one more time. Where are we?
Intelligence rules. Okay, meta
instructions. Again, first check if
clarification is needed before
generating the prompt. Also, it then
goes and reads the prompt folder to make
sure that um either it exists, if it
doesn't exist, and if it does, what the
number should be. It keeps prompt file
names descriptive but concise. Adapt the
XML structure to fit the task. Not every
tag is needed every time. Consider the
user's working directory as the root for
all relative paths. Each prompt should
contain only the prompt content, no
preamble or explanation. And after
saving, present the appropriate decision
tree blah blah blah blah blah. Let's
just close this up. We got one final
thing down here of examples when to ask
for clarification. If I said build a
dashboard, you should ask the user what
kind of dashboard, admin, analytics,
userfacing, what data should it display,
fix the bug, can you describe the bug?
These are very simple things, but you
know, you want for the prompt to push
back if it doesn't feel it has the
clarity. Okay, so this is the essence of
meta prompting is the goal is not to
tell Claude what you want it to do. The
goal is to tell Claude what you would
want it to do and therefore how would it
like best to be asked to achieve that
instead of explaining what you want and
getting it to do it. You want to get it
to think about how it would best do the
task and create a prompt for that. Now,
what I love to do is not just run this
prompt directly in line in this chat
window. You know, once the prompt is
created, if I were to just say run
prompt and then I actually like tag the
prompt, it's going to use up a hell of a
lot of context in this chat window. Um,
and also in the creation of that prompt,
it's used up a lot of context in
thinking about how to create the prompt,
which means we've actually polluted the
the entire chat with context that is not
necessary while it's figuring out what
to do. The prompt in and of itself is a
self-contained solution to the problem,
which is why I have this next prompt
here called run prompt. Let's just fold
this up. Um, where are we? Uh I suppose
we can't easily fold this up in the same
way but the goal of this prompt is to
execute one or more prompts from the
folder as delegated subtasks. This is
that key thing. Um these are when they
spawn sub aents. So these are
self-contained fresh context sub aents.
The user specifies which prompt to run
via arguments or because this is in line
it will just know what to do. But the
point is here if it's an single prompt
it runs it on in and of itself. If it's
multiple prompts blah blah blah blah
blah. You can see here um a little bit
more context, not super interesting to
read through, but it's basically just
explaining to Claude exactly how to
launch these prompts as subtasks. So,
let's actually have a look to see here
how we would use this in practice. So,
I'm going to run exactly the same prompt
in two different windows, except in one
of them, I'm going to create a prompt
for the prompt and then run that. and in
another I'm just gonna get Claude to do
it in one shot with no more context. So,
first I'm going to copy and paste this
prompt and I'm going to run this in the
this this little folder is called with
metarrompting and then I'm going to
create one which is without metaring.
So, let's just go ahead and run that.
And I'm going to put this over here for
clarity. And then I'm going to create
another window. And I'm going to go back
and I'm going to go into the without
meta prompting. And I'm going to just
give it that exact direct prompt. So,
we'll say I want to create a CLI based
tool. We'll go enter. So, let's have a
little look here. You can see that it's
already asked for a bit more um a little
bit more context. Whereas with here,
it's probably There we go. It's just
going I'll create a generative music CLI
tool with trippy visuals. Straight away
it started to create it. Whereas here it
wants some context. So audio library
preferences. Do you want to use a
specific node.js audio library or open
to recommendations? In this case I'm
going to say I'm
uh I'm open to the best uh library for
this given the goal. In this case, I
don't really know. Visual rendering.
Should this use terminal graphics
library like blessed? Yes, use blessed
and make it beautiful and rainbow like
and trippy.
Number three, note sequencing. You
mentioned 75% chance each 16th note
plays. Should the pentatonic notes be
picked randomly? Uh, let's do randomly.
uh with a waiting towards
uh roots, octaves and
first and then fifths and then uh thirds
etc. The goal should be that it sounds
pleasing. Cool. Number four, runtime.
Should this run indefinitely until
stopped? Yes, indefinitely
until controll C. And then five, are you
okay with installing npm packages for
this or do you want minimal
dependencies? Yes, that's fine to
install. So, I'm going to run with this.
Let's go back over here. You can see
that already Claude has created in this
view a version of this. So, let's just
give it a go. I'm going to do npm start
and I'm going to open this up in another
tab and let's just let's just see. Let's
just see what happened. Obviously, it
was a lot quicker without meta
prompting, but let's see what the
quality of the results are.
[music]
Okay, so it did something, [music]
but it's a bit [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] really.
So, I'm going to close that out.
Stopping the music. I hate how it uses
these emojis, but it did something. So,
I'm curious to see now the quality of
the difference here. Let's just make
these the same color so that we can see
which one is which. I'm going to go back
to the prompt here. So, should I
proceed? Yes. Cool. So, Claude has gone
ahead and created this prompt. Let's
have a little look to see what it is.
Let's just widen this for a second. So,
the Here we go. The the objective. Build
a terminalbased generative music
application that creates pleasing blah
blah blah blah blah. This is for
personal creative exploration and
ambient background music generated.
Nice. Here's the context. This is a new
node.js CLI application. Audio
requirements. Here are all of the
specific things that are needed. The
visual requirements. It needs to use
trippy colorful rainbow like aesthetics.
Runtime requirements. Technical
approach. So, it's going to analyze the
best approach for this implementation.
Considering the audio library selection,
[snorts]
um, timing architecture, harmonic
waiting, sample and hold logic, what to
avoid? Avoid blocking operations,
uniform random note selection. Avoid
updating sample and hold every note.
Avoid synchronous blocking, blah blah
blah blah blah. It's already decided
what the project should look like.
Success criteria and then verification.
Can you run the application? Let it play
for 30 seconds. These kind of things
probably do require my effort, but let's
go ahead. So now all I have to do is
just press one. And you're going to see
that instead of now running it in this
window, it's going to launch the run
prompt prompt to then run said prompt.
You can see it's gone and found it in
this directory. I can show you that this
folder itself only has in it prompts.
Let's have a look in there. CD
prompts. And inside of there is that
folder. What's also nice is once the
prompt has been run, it's going to
relegate that prompt to a folder called
completed. So, let's close this up and
we're going to see what's happening.
This task indicates that this is now
running in its own self-contained sub
agent workflow. Once it starts doing
stuff, we can press control O uh wrong
button control O and you'll be able to
see exactly what's happening. So, right
here, it's passed through that prompt.
Let's get out of here. And we can see
that very shortly it's going to start
writing and reading and thinking about
files. So let's just let that run and
we'll come back to it in a second to see
what it's done. Okay, I've just got back
from my breakfast bagel and Claude seems
to have completed the task. We can see
here that it has created various files,
the key implementation details, yada
yada yada, and then the tools to run it.
So I'm going to go ahead and do npm
install. Let's just do this in a new
tab. uh an npm install. Let's make this
green as well. And then we want to do
npm start. Very nice that we've got a
high security vulnerability there. Let's
give it a go.
[music]
Kind of nice. I like that. And I think
you'll agree that the overall
adherence to my original prompt of
having a bit more of like a a structured
randomness
[music]
compared to this
this buggy clicky whatever's going on
here. This is a damn a damn lot better.
[music]
Nice. Okay. So just to verify one more
time that how much more effective this
is. I want to do a little uh adjustment
to this. So now I want to do I want to
add uh I'm going to do this with create
prompt again as well. So create prompt.
I want to add uh more of a rainbow
fractal fractal trippy visual aspect to
it as well as
some sample and hold slightly affecting
the sine waves
uh feedback to create little timberal
tambberal changes.
And also I want to be able to uh select
different scales in real time by
pressing
the right and left arrow keys. So I'm
just going to run this in here. And then
I'm also going to go back over here and
I'm going to say I want to add exactly
the same thing, but we're going to do it
straight one shot and then with a prompt
in between. So let's see how this runs.
and uh we'll compare the results. Okay,
so it actually wants a little bit more
clarification. Rainbow fractal visuals.
Do you want actual fractal patterns like
mandelro?
Um
I'm thinking something between mandal
brought and spirals and making it
evolving
uh and generative and directly related
to the music. Okay. Number two, sine
wave feedback. Should this be actual
audio feedback delay or FM synthesis
style? FM synthesis style modulation.
Subtle warmth. Three. Scale selection.
Should there be a visual indicator
showing which selection? Um, we'll say
yes. It should show in the bottom right.
And we should do all of the modes of the
major scale
and also the two pentatonic scales and
then four uh as I said above. And I
think what's nice about this is it
really helps you refine what it is that
you want when you're asked more
questions about it. And of course,
instead of saying continue, I could have
said after this, ask me some more
questions as well. And that's so key to
being able to just be sure that what it
is that you're you're prompting for is
um is going to be what you want because
sometimes you actually have to ask
yourself the questions, do I want this?
Do I want that? How do I envision it? If
if you don't know, then Claude
definitely isn't going to know. So,
let's run the updated version here in
the oneshot prompt.
&gt;&gt; [music]
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, you can see that it's creating
some really kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up problems
here that weren't really fixed. This
does look quite nice. I like that a lot.
Let's actually see if we were to run
this um if we were to run this in just
regular terminal to see if that makes it
any better.
npm start.
[music]
Okay, so we're still having all sorts of
problems there. I do love those colors.
Those are really very nice. Can I change
scale?
We're in pentatonic minor now.
[music]
Major minor. Cool. So, it does work, but
it's not quite what I want. So, let's go
back to here, and we should in theory
have our updated prompt. So, let's run
it, and then let's see what we get.
While that's running, let's actually
have a look to see what the prompt was
like that it created for this
enhancement. So the objective enhancing
the existing music CLI tool with these
three main improvements context the
existing application. This is important.
It tells it about what we already have.
Examine these files. It wants to be a
more trippy fractal-based situation.
Here's the visual enhancement
requirements. So we need it to be more
fractal with generative and continuously
evolving visual style maintaining
rainbow spectrum but they should be
trippy and mesmerizing. Consider uni-ode
box drawing performance blah blah blah
blah blah audio enhancement
requirements. So now we need to add in a
little bit more complexity which is that
feedback which to be honest I don't
think we even really had in this view.
Um
[music]
maybe a little bit but very subtle. Um
and then let's have a little look here.
Interactive scale selection
uh keyboards. You just see like how
indepth this is and all I had to do was
just answer a couple of questions. So
technical approach research fractal
generation suitable for terminal
rendering. This is baked into the prompt
before it does anything else.
Scale system FM system. Very nice. What
to avoid and why? Avoid complex fractal
algorithms in the audio of Fred. Avoid
harsh FM tambers. Um, yep, great. Avoid
pixel perfect fractal rendering. Modify
existing files, these ones. And here are
the success criteria as well as then
verification.
Very nice. So, this looks as though it's
about to finish. Um, I'd be curious to
know exactly how long it took to do. Uh,
but we'll come back to this in one
moment. Okay. It took about 8 minutes to
complete that prompt, but we are now uh
done. Just before we dial that in, let's
give it one more occasion of the cheap
buggy crappy one, the oneshot prompt
versus what it would be if we did those
two prompts. So, here we go. I'm very
excited.
[music]
Let's change key. Bit weird what's
happening up here with the text.
[music] And now we're in pentatonic
minor.
Let's do 3GM.
[music]
Oh, Lydian. We got a bunch of nice
scales in. Anyway, you get the idea. I
think what's just really great about
this approach is not just does it help
you understand what you want before you
ask for it, but it just makes the entire
process of actually prompting
so much easier because you don't have to
think about the things that the LLM will
need as a human being like okay well
what does Claude need instead you ask
Claude what do you need out of interest
let's just check out the codebase here
I've got the without metaring and with
metaring here let's just have a look to
see how it was even constructed so when
I just asked for it without creating
prompts beforehand it created just this
I was going to say a monolith but it's
not even really a very big file file.
It's a 286 line single index.js and then
it's got some node modules here. Um,
that's it. Let's see how it organized
things in the prompt based one. So, you
can see here that we've got that
index.js entry point. It's only 63 lines
long and it references the source files
here where we've got an independent
script for audio. We've also then got an
independent script for visuals here. Um,
very nice. We've even got a little read
me here that explains exactly how to use
it, all that sorts of information.
So, I know that this seems um
potentially a little bit long- winded,
you know, and as I said at the beginning
of this video, if you just want to
change the background color of something
to red to yellow, or you want to change
a font, there's no point you wasting the
time uh getting Claude to think about
how it should ask itself to do that
thing. But when you want to compound the
upgrades of what you want to make to
your system, to your codebase, I highly
recommend running this prompt beforehand
because the quality, as you can see, is
just so much better. I know that we
looked at it today in the context of
creating a CLI based tool, but this
works for refactoring, this works for
database migrations, this works for
whatever it is that you want to do that
requires a little bit more thought than
just do X thing. Um, so highly recommend
it. I'm going to put the link to be able
to download this prompt in the
description down below. Give it a go and
let me know what you think. And uh also
let me know if you're interested in any
more videos about some of the prompts
that I use. I've got a couple of really
exciting ones that I think we could look
at next. But in the meantime, uh that's
all that's all folks and thank you for
watching.
