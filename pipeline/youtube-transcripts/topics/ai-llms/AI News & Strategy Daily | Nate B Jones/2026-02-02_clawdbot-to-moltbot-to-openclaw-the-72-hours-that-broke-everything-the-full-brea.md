In hundreds of cities across the globe
right now, developers are queuing up to
buy Mac minis specifically to give an AI
agent root access to their digital life.
And they are not alone. Apple's entire
supply chain is feeling it. You can see
literal spikes in Google Trends.
Cloudflare's stock is up over 20%
because this thing uses Cloudflare. What
is it? Is it an info steeler malware in
disguise? Well, that's what Google's
vice president of security engineering
calls it. Uh, no. It's actually moltbot
until a couple of days ago. It was
called Claudebot because it mostly uses
claude. Claude with a like claw. The
name change was not voluntary.
Anthropics lawyers got after that. Quick
update in the edit. Now it's called open
claw. Steinberger says this one's
sticking and the trademark searches came
back clear. This is the story of how a
lobster themed AI assistant became the
fastest growing open-source project in
GitHub history. what it reveals about
where personal computing is headed and
why the most interesting question is not
whether you personally should run it. It
is whether Agentic AI is going to be
safe to run locally for individuals. So
what is Maltbot, formerly known as
Claudebot? If you strip away the hype,
it's a very simple idea executed very
ambitiously. It's an AI assistant that
runs on your hardware, talks to you
through apps you already use, and
actually does things instead of just
suggesting them. So, you message it on
WhatsApp, it reads your emails, it
triages your inbox, it drafts responses,
you tell it to book a flight, it opens a
browser, it searches, it fills out
forms, it confirms, you ask for the
morning briefing. You get that before
you finish your coffee. The tagline is
AI that actually does things. That's not
marketing fluff. It is the core value
prop and the core risk condensed into
five words. Technically, Moltbot is a
gateway service that maintains websocket
connections to various messaging
platforms. It's not just WhatsApp. You
can do Telegram and Signal and iMessage,
etc. And it orchestrates interactions
with an LLM backend. Think Claude
typically, but sometimes GPT4. And there
are some local models like Olama that
are available too. And then it uses a
growing library of skills that basically
gives it hands and feet capabilities,
right? browser automation, file system
access, shell commands, calendar
integration, you name it. The entire
architecture is local first, which means
that the gateway runs on your machine.
Your conversation history stays on your
machine. Your credentials stay on your
machine. You get the idea. It's privacy
first. But local first does not mean
local only. Unless you're running a
local model like O Lama, your queries
still run to Anthropic or OpenAI's APIs.
You own the agent layer. You rent the
intelligence. Peter Steinberger built
the first version for himself after
stepping away from a PDF company he
founded and sold to Insight Partners.
He'd barely touched a computer in 3
years, and he rediscovered his spark
playing with Claude, and he started to
build tools to manage his own digital
chaos and eventually open sourced the
result with a little lobster mascot
named Claude with a W. Within 24 hours,
Claude with a W had 9,000. A week later,
60,000. This is how fast things move in
the age of AI and it's over 82,000 stars
now. I'm sure it will be much higher by
the time you see this. Andre Carpathy
praised it publicly and I think one
user's summary captured my mood and a
lot of other people's mood really,
really well. At this point, I don't even
know what to call moldbot. It is
something new and after a few weeks with
it. This is the first time I felt like
I'm living in the future. That that is
what it feels like. I've used it and it
is either the future of personal
computing or it is a gigantic collective
hallucination and it might possibly be
both and I want to talk about that
because most of the maltbot conversation
is all hype. It's the p future of
personal computing. It's incredible.
You're going to want it etc. etc. There
are reasons not to want this and we're
going to go into that. But first we
should talk about the growth. Anytime
you can get to 90,000 or 82,000 or
however many thousand GitHub stars it
has by now you're going to move markets.
Not just Anthropic Market as a private
company, but Cloudflare is a publicly
traded company. For a local AI agent to
be useful, it will need to communicate
with the outside world. And that's where
Cloudflare comes in. And that's why
their stock price moved because anytime
Claudebot or now Moltbot needs to touch
the outside world, it has to expose its
home network to the open internet, which
is very dangerous unless something comes
in between it. and Cloudflare tunnels
provide effectively a secure bridge from
your local home network to the internet
and it allows developers to expose local
services safely. Moltbot's documentation
recommends it and the community has
adopted it enthusiastically. This causes
Cloudflare stock to rise. It's up some
20% at last count. I don't know where it
is now. That's the point is not the
exact amount it gained. The point is
that we are in a world where AI is
moving so fast it can change the value
of a publicly traded company by a fifth
within a few days. Now, here's some of
the reasons why you should be skeptical.
First, operational discipline. On
January 27th, Anthropic's legal team
took notice of this and sent Steinberger
a trademark notice. The name Claude was
too close to Claude. Like Claude with a
W is too close to Claude with a U. He
was required to change it. The timing
was really rough, right? The project is
at peak velocity. Attention is
absolutely white hot. The community is
exploding. Announcing a rebrand to
Maltbot is not what you want, but he had
to do it. Steinberger did his best, but
he made a mistake that's going to be
studied in operational security courses
for years to come. When changing the
GitHub or name and the X handle, he
released the old names before securing
the new ones. The gap was approximately
10 seconds. In that 10-second window,
crypto scammers grabbed both accounts.
This wasn't a hack. They were waiting.
They were watching. The moment Claudebot
became available, they snatched it. And
what followed was absolute chaos. A fake
Claude token appeared on Solana, riding
the viral wave. It hit $16 million in
market cap before collapsing. A classic
rugpull that wrecked late buyers while
scammers walked away with millions. Fake
accounts proliferated. Steinberger's
mentions filled with speculators
demanding he endorse tokens he'd never
even heard of. To all crypto folks, he
begged, "Please stop pinging me. Any
project that lists me as a coin owner is
a scam. I feel for him. This is not what
he signed up for when he wrote a little
home automation tool." Meanwhile,
security researchers have been poking at
the actual codebase. And what they found
there wasn't reassuring either. Jameson
O'Reilly, founder of red teaming firm
DVULN, I don't know how to pronounce
that either, probably DVOM, discovered
that the gateways authentication logic
trusted all local host connections by
default. This is not good. If you run
Moltbot behind a reverse proxy, which is
a very common deployment pattern, that
proxy traffic gets treated by default as
local. There's no off required. You get
full access to credentials. You get all
conversation history. you get the
privilege to command execution. This is
not good because it allows outside
traffic to hijack Claudebot or now
Moldbot. When he did a scan, he found
hundreds of exposed instances from
developers who had installed Moldbot.
And of those he examined manually, at
least eight were completely open. API
keys were open, Telegram bot tokens were
open, one exposed instance had Signal
configured on a public server. This is a
disaster and it shows what happens when
you have open-source projects that are
not properly secured. A separate
researcher Matt Vukoule demonstrated the
severity with a proof of concept. He
sent a single malicious email to a
vulnerable maltbot instance with email
integration enabled. Via prompt
injection. He got a private key and
control in under 5 minutes. But O'Reilly
kept going further. He uploaded a benign
skill to Claude Hub, which is Moltbot's
plug-in marketplace. presumably that
needs a new name. And he artificially
inflated the download count to 4,000 and
then immediately watched developers from
seven different countries install it.
The skill did nothing malicious, but it
was so easy to do that it easily could
have. Anybody could have done that.
QuadHub has zero moderation process. Its
developer notes literally state that all
downloaded code will be treated as
trusted code, which is a disaster.
Meanwhile, security firm Slowmist got in
on the action, announcing that an
authentication bypass made several
hundred API keys and private
conversation histories accessible. If
this is giving you high blood pressure,
it should. The trademark dispute, the
scam tokens, the security disclosures,
the account hijacking, all happened
within 72 hours. And here's where the
analysis gets really uncomfortable. The
vulnerabilities researchers found are
very real and very serious. Some of them
have been patched. The local host
authentication issue is fixed.
Steinberger is responsible. The
community is engaged. But the deeper
problem isn't these individual bugs.
It's architecture. It's what Maltbot is
designed to do. I think O'Reilly put
this well. He said, "We've spent 20
years essentially building security
boundaries around our oss and everything
that we've done is designed to contain
and limit scope of action. But agents
require us to tear that down by the
nature of what an agent is. An agent
needs hands and feet to do things. It
needs to read your files to access your
credentials to get commands done. The
value proposition requires punching
holes through every boundary that
security teams took a long time, decades
in some cases to build. That is the
bind. A useful agentic AI requires
fairly broad permissions and broad
permissions create a massive attack
surface. This is why Google has
emphasized control panes for agents and
why enterprises take agent attack
surfaces extremely seriously. At this
point, enterprises are much much safer
places to install and run agents because
they take that security seriously. And
open-source, especially after the last
week or so, is looking very much like an
unsafe place to run agents. Consider
prompt injection. Moltbot connects to
your email, your messaging apps, your
social accounts, it reads incoming
content and it acts on it. But LLMs
cannot reliably distinguish instructions
from content. So if an attacker sends
you a carefully crafted WhatsApp message
with hidden instructions, Maltbot will
treat it as trusted input. It will
follow the instructions. It may forward
your credentials. Maybe it executes a
shell command and you never see this
coming. This is not a Moltbot specific
flaw. It's intrinsic to how language
models process text. No one has solved
it. And the only way enterprises are
addressing it are by reducing the kind
of content that these agents have access
to and reducing the degree to which
these agents have access to the public
internet and also internal files. This
is why Google's principles for agentic
management for enterprise emphasize a
lease privilege stance. You treat the
agent like a junior employee and you do
not assume that it gets access to
anything. But consider the supply chain
for Moltbot. Multbot's extensibility is
a feature, right? It comes with 50 plus
bundled skills. It comes with a growing
marketplace. It comes with infinite
customization. And every single plugin,
unlike a least privilege dance, it's
just unodudited code running with the
permissions you've granted the agent.
One malicious update and your personal
AI assistant becomes an exfiltration
tool. One password security blog got in
on the action and put it very clearly.
Moltbot shows how powerful local AI
agents can be. But if your agent stores
plain text API keys, an info stealer can
grab them in seconds. Running Moltbot
safely largely defeats the purpose of
Maltbot because a sandboxed assistant
can't access your real email and
calendar. And so the security utility
trade-off here is effectively being
solved by companies tackling secure
integrations with individual tools
rather than by open-source. And so when
Gemini comes and says we have a great
tool for Gmail, Google is standing
behind that. Google is saying the AI
here is not just randomly exposed and
sending your open AI keys to the
internet. They're not saying you're
sending your Gemini keys to the
internet. They're not saying you're
sending your API keys to the internet.
They are saying that we have built an AI
experience inside email that is safer.
The trade-off is speed, right? Part of
what makes Claudebot compelling, part of
what makes Maltbot compelling is that
you don't have to wait to have a local
agent that does everything for you. And
a lot of people turn out to want to not
wait. A lot of people want to go faster.
And that is leading to the compute
squeeze that we're not talking about
enough. If you zoom out further, if you
zoom out beyond the security issues, the
Mac Mini buying frenzy that came with
Moltbot is not just FOMO on a viral
project, it is colliding with a
structural shift in semiconductor
economics that's been building up for
the last 2 years. And it's exactly why
we're going to see more and more
products like Lindy or like Naden or
like Gemini serving in Gmail full
enterprise AI implementations rather
than a bunch of open- source projects
despite how popular they are. The reason
is price. DRAM prices have surged 172%
since early 2025. Server memory is
expected to double in cost by late 2026.
This is not a cyclical drive. This is a
structural change in cost. AI data
centers are consuming an ever larger
share of global wafer capacity and the
memory manufacturers are just following
their margins. High bandwidth memory for
AI accelerators consumes four times the
wafer capacity of a standard DRAM per
gigabyte. Every single chip that goes to
Nvidia is a chip that is not going into
your laptop. Samsung, SKH Highix, and
Micron have all signed multi-year supply
deals with AI hyperscalers and they're
locking in capacity. Consumer memory is
getting the floor sweeping scope. If you
reframe Mobbot through this lens, the
Mac Mini supply chain run looks
different. People are not just excited
about a cool new tool. They're trying to
lock in some personal compute capacity
while they still can. It's a hedge,
conscious or not, against a future where
running local AI is going to get priced
out. The irony is so sharp and it's not
lost on me. Moltbot promises sovereignty
over your AI stack, but most Moltbot
instances still route to Claude's API.
You own the agency layer. You rent the
intelligence from Anthropics data
centers. The escape hatch, local models
via Lama, requires the RAM that's
flowing to those same data centers. The
sovereignty play loops back to a
dependency on hyperscalers. The window
for truly local AI may be narrowing
really really fast as economics tilt
against consumer hardware. But let's
step back and ask the question, why is
Maltbot so popular in the first place?
We've talked about the vulnerability.
We've talked about the supply chain
headaches for over a decade. Tech
companies have promised us AI assistance
that would transform our lives and
largely they have lied. Dairy arrived in
2011. Google Assistant followed in 2016.
Alexa has colonized millions of kitchens
with a timer. And yet, in 2026, most of
us are frustrated. We're repeating
ourselves. We're wondering why our smart
assistants can't remember the
conversation from 5 minutes ago. Maltbot
exposes how timid those efforts have
been. Apple Siri just lives in a little
walled garden. It's limited to Apple's
approved integrations. It can't book you
a flight. Google Assistant knows
everything about you, but does almost
nothing with that knowledge. Alexa
controls your lights, but can't manage
your inbox. Moltbot does what those
companies promised and never delivered
on. It manages calendars across
platforms. It drafts emails in your
voice. It handles travel logistics end
to end. It commits code to your repos.
It monitors prices and rebooks when
deals appear. It remembers. It acts
proactively. The tradeoff is that
Maltbot requires you to trust it
completely. Is safe because it's
neutered. Moldbot is useful because it's
dangerous. The big tech assistants are
products designed to protect corporate
liability. Moltbot is a tool designed to
maximize user capability. And that's
just an observation about what the
market was hungry for. It turns out that
tens of thousands of GitHub stars in
weeks implies a lot of pent-up demand
for assistance that actually assists. I
would be remiss if I did not call out
some of the really eye-opening things
Maltbot does because I don't want you to
walk away and hear that it's only about
the security vulnerabilities. People are
flocking to this because of the power it
brings to their computer day in day out.
Despite all of it, Moltbot works well.
Even the one password security team
while documenting the risks shared an
anecdote that captures why people are
excited. A user asked Maltbot to make a
restaurant reservation. Open Table
didn't have the availability. So,
Maltbot went, found AI voice software,
downloaded it, called the restaurant
directly, and secured the reservation
over the phone. Zero human intervention,
problem-solving behavior that emerged
from the combination of broad
permissions and a capable model. That is
something new. It's exciting. And the
demos flooding social media are not just
productivity theater. It's not just
email inbox triage. There's some really
new capabilities. One developer
configured Maltbot to run coding agents
overnight. He would describe features
before bed. He would wake up to working
implementations and review the code over
coffee. Another built a complete Laravel
application while walking to get coffee,
issuing instructions via WhatsApp,
watching the commits literally land in
his repo as he strolled along to the
coffee shop. Steve Caldwell set up a
weekly meal planning system in Notion.
Maltbot checks what's in season, cross
references family preferences, generates
the grocery list, and updates the
calendar. It saves him an hour a week.
self-improvement capability is one of
the things that really makes me sit up.
If you tell Maltbot to create a skill to
monitor flight prices and alert me when
they drop below $300, it will write that
entire automation itself. And if you
tell it to self-improve, it will do so.
The pattern among successful users, and
there are many, is that they're not
automating busy work. They're delegating
judgment requiring tasks to a system
that can handle a lot of ambiguity,
recover from failures, and find
alternative approaches. is when the
first attempt doesn't work. The
restaurant reservation story is not
impressive because it made a phone call.
It's impressive because the AI
recognized the initial approach didn't
work and autonomously went and found a
different solution. And that's exactly
what makes it dangerous. The same
capability that lets it problem solve
creatively is the capability that lets a
prompt injection attack succeed in new
ways. So the honest question is should
you run it? And the honest answer is it
depends on who you are. If you are very
technically sophisticated, if you
understand VPS deployments, network
isolation, credential rotation, the
difference between local host and
0.0.0.0,
Moldbot offers a genuine glimpse of
where personal AI is headed. You can run
it on dedicated hardware. You can use
throwaway accounts for initial testing.
You can sandbox it aggressively. If what
I just said for the last 30 seconds felt
like jargon, though, you should wait.
The project is young. The security model
is immature and you should let truly
wellfunded good companies build agents
that will work for you. And that is 99%
of us. And especially if you handle
sensitive data professionally, do not
connect Maltbot to any of your systems.
Not financial records, not health
information, not client communications.
The upside just isn't worth the extra
liability. And and last but not least,
do not buy any claw tokens. It is a
scam. You know, if we step back, Agentic
AI is coming regardless. The ability to
delegate tasks to AI systems that can
act autonomously is not a question of
if, but when and how. Maltbot is an
accelerated preview. It's like Mad Max.
It's messy. It's risky. It's
exhilarating. It's problematic. And it
shows you a glimpse of what the future
could look like with all the guardrails
off. Now, the security model for Agentic
AI is still developing. We're still
figuring out how to bolt capabilities
onto permission frameworks designed for
a different era and the economics of
personal computing are shifting at the
same time and so trying to figure out
where these agents live remains a big
question mark. I have very high
conviction that if we are at a point now
where Moldbot is exploding and taking
off, we will be at a point in 3 months
where a bunch of VCF funded agents are
going to be on the market competing for
our attention with professional security
guard rails in place. In fact, I've seen
two or three of them that have
conveniently popped up in just the last
couple days as Maltbot has taken off.
I'm going to wait and see how they shake
out before reviewing them. But it's
worth noting that where there are 90,000
GitHub stars or 82,000 or however many
thousand there are by the time you get
there, there's going to be VC money and
there's going to be agents that are
built with software standards that far
exceed an open-source application.
Moltbot did not create the tensions I've
discussed today. All Moltbot did was tap
into demand that was so viral it made
them impossible to ignore. Maltbot is a
messy glimpse at the future and I think
it's worth paying attention to because
it allows us to take that time machine
into later 2026 and see how powerful an
agent can be. In particular, I am so
excited for agents that actually have
the ability to autonomously work through
obstacles and generate novel solutions
when I didn't give them specific
instructions. That's going to be really
cool. It's coming this year. Boltbot is
only for advanced users and it's very
much a use at your own risk tool.
