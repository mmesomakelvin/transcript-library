Cognitive optimization. How do we
allocate our brains processing power
more optimally so we can think better
and do more? One effective way to do
this is to build a second brain. The
term second brain has been floating
around for years. Most of the advice
around it focuses on organizing
information, but that's solving the
wrong problem. While information storage
is part of what a second brain does,
that alone does not lead to better
thinking and certainly not more things
done. The actual problem that a second
brain can solve is cognitive state
management. To use an AI agent's
analogy, engineering your brain's
context window. The brain having to
manage its own states limits
performance. Tracking projects, holding
onto ideas, remembering where things
are, and overall maintaining context
across everything you're doing. So, I'll
share my own take on this second brain
that has actually made me think better
and get more stuff done. I'm not
presenting this as the correct way of
doing things. Uh just some philosophy
and ideas for you to think about and
either accept or not.
&gt;&gt; [music]
&gt;&gt; Most note-taking systems treat all
cognitive content as one thing.
Information comes in, you organize it,
and retrieve it later. But, cognitive
content comes in two types that behave
in opposite ways and they cannot be
treated equally. Type one, knowledge,
stuff outside your brain moving in.
Information transfers from the external
world and integrates into your existing
mental models. The role of knowledge is
to expand your ability for one, having
ideas, and two, capacity to execute on
them. Understanding group theory doesn't
clog your working memory. It doesn't
compete with your active thinking, but
it kind of expands what your brain can
do. It adds new machinery to think with.
Type two ideas, stuff inside your brain
moving out. Your brain synthesizes in
the background and you can't really
control when ideas arrive. They come
sporadically, uninvited, and unlike
knowledge, they don't integrate silently
into your mind. Instead, they sit in
working memory. They demand attention.
They compete for the same resources you
need for whatever you're working on
right now. Holding on to ideas is sort
of like background processes consuming
CPU and there's a significant tension
here cuz ideas are or how you create
value. So, you can't just throw them
away, obviously.
But, you can't really hold on to them,
either, cuz every idea sitting in your
working memory takes away resources from
your processor. There's a cognitive tax
on every unresolved thoughts. Ideas have
to be moved. They have to be saved
immediately into an external storage.
Knowledge in, ideas out. The two
directions of transfer plus the reason
they both exist give you the three
operations between your brain and an
external system. Operation one, build
knowledge. Download information from the
world into your own brain. Books,
papers, lecture notes, courses, code.
And the notes which say quite learning
are transfer artifacts. They help you
absorb the material. They're not
Wikipedia articles. They're just the
tools for installation. A means to an
end and they help you to manage states.
Your notes tell you exactly where you
left off and they make it easy for your
brain to reorient itself back to the
subject you're trying to learn.
Operation two, capture ideas. You got to
push ideas out of your brain into an
external system the moment they arrive.
No sorting, no categorizing, no
processing, just purely evacuation. So,
the goal is to free up working memory,
so your brain can return to whatever it
was working on before the idea
interrupted. You process the idea later.
Operation three, execute. You take your
knowledge and your ideas and produce
something. And this is the reason why
the first two operations exist. The
whole point is to do stuff. I mean,
what's the point of building a elaborate
personal information hoarding system if
you don't ever actually do anything with
the stuff. All right. The idea capture
needs to be done right. You write the
idea down, and you keep thinking about
it anyway. Since your brain doesn't
trust the system, you aren't confident
you'll ever see that note again. So,
your brain still maintains a background
copy, which then burns resources on
something you've already captured. This
is an idea I'm borrowing from No
Boilerplate. I'm not sure if he coined
the term, but the temporal contract is
an agreement between your present self
and your future self. Two rules. Rule
one, every fleeting idea goes into one
trusted location the moment it arrives.
One place, no decisions about where it
belongs. Zero friction. Rule two, you
will revisit your captures. You must
commit to coming back. The frequency and
format are up to you, but the commitment
is non-negotiable. Your brain needs to
believe that what you wrote down will
surface again. These two rules create a
trust loop. Your present self captures
the idea knowing future you will revisit
it. And future you revisits the idea
knowing that past you captured
everything worth capturing. The
commitment makes the system trustworthy.
And because the system is trustworthy,
your brain can release the idea and
safely forget about it. It's a It's sort
of like a Git commit. Once you commit,
the state is saved and you move on. Uh
let's get to implementation. Now,
[clears throat] there are many ways to
overcomplicate this and no one right way
to do it. What matters are the
underlying principles and the philosophy
and not really the specifics on how you
implement this yourself. But, I'll share
my implementation here. The second brain
is just a folder on your computer. No
proprietary platform, no subscriptions.
A directory of text files is is all you
need. Now, Obsidian. This is where we
got to be a bit careful cuz Obsidian is
nothing magical. It's just a file
manager that's got some markdown editing
capabilities. So, very clear, Obsidian
is not the system. It's just one
possible way to interact with the
folder. But, Obsidian's got a few
features that really help with the three
operations. First, links. You connect
notes to other notes without having to
pre-decide or plan where notes should
go. Structure emerges from connections
rather than imposed folder structures or
taxonomies. So, this eliminates the
mental work of having to decide where an
idea should go. It eliminates friction.
It creates the organization for you. And
also, ideas don't really form a
hierarchy. The [snorts] idea graph is a
is a more effective way of organizing
ideas. Secondly, fleeting notes,
dedicated space for the temporal
contract. No categorization, no tagging,
no deciding where it belongs. You just
capture and move on. The processing then
happens when you revisit the idea.
Useful community plugins, this one
embeds your notes in a vector database
to identify semantically similar notes.
This one adds a calendar, this one adds
a terminal, this one adds LaTeX snippets
to make writing math a lot more
efficient. Absolutely essential if
you're going to be writing equations.
The point is that the community is
massive and you can mold Obsidian to fit
your needs. Then, a very important,
plain text. Markdown files are portable,
future-proof, readable by any text
editor, and readable by AI. All right,
let's look at a vault structure. My
top-level directories are for the three
operations:
building knowledge, capturing ideas, and
managing projects. Domains, thoughts,
projects.
Yeah, the Greeks are kind of just there
to emphasize the significance
of each component.
And oh, yeah, I've also got one
additional folder for vault management.
So, for storing image files, note
templates, the inbox, and the AI. So,
this is my implementation. The
architecture and the protocols work
regardless of what software you choose.
The underlying principles run deeper
than the than the tools for execution.
So, again, Obsidian is not the second
brain. Obsidian is just a tool to
interact with it. Everything I've
described here works without AI. People
have run effective second brains with a
pen and paper for centuries, but
something has changed in the last few
years and it kind of changes the value
proposition of the entire system. AI is
also a big part of why second brains are
kind of gaining traction again. AI
running inside of your second brain has
your cognitive state. It knows what
you've been learning, what ideas you've
captured, and what you're working on.
The role of the AI in your second brain
is to allow you to move faster. It's
efficiency. So, across the three
operations, building knowledge, AI can
act as a personal tutor calibrated to
your understanding. It knows what you
know and maps new concepts onto mental
models that you already have instead of
starting from generic explanations that
may be too basic or too advanced. For
capturing ideas, you can talk to your
ideas. You can capture half-formed
thoughts and AI can then challenge it,
expand on it, connect it to outside
knowledge, or something you wrote 3
months ago. You can develop the idea a
lot more efficiently with a thinking
partner. And then for execution, AI can
draft from your notes, explore solution
spaces, and exhaust approaches faster
than you could alone. But, one very
important caveat on this, you cannot
hand over the thinking. AI can challenge
your ideas, map connections, explore
solution spaces, but it cannot replace
your judgment, your taste. The real
value still comes from your brain doing
what it does best. AI's role is just to
remove friction,
handle the surrounding mechanical work,
so you can allocate more of your
cognitive resources to to the parts that
count. The decisions, the synthesis, the
original thinking that no LLM can
replicate. To close the video, I want to
add one more constraint to this cuz it
is easy. It is It's too easy for a
system like this to become a
procrastination tool. And I've been
there. Building beautiful knowledge
graphs, perfecting your folder
structures, writing detailed Wikipedia
articles. It's all kind of feels
productive, but it's doing nothing. None
of it actually gets stuff done. The
whole point of building a system like
this is to do things. The It's the
execution layer that really matters. The
whole system exists to do stuff in the
real world. You cannot fall into the
trap of pseudo-productivity,
especially with Obsidian. Obsidian is
really satisfying. So,
you got to be careful with this. The
value of a second brain is measured in
what you produce with it. Use it to
think better, capture faster, and
execute harder. The whole point is to
make stuff happen.
