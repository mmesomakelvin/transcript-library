Last week, we processed 5 million leads
for our cold email campaigns using a
completely proprietary system vibe coded
with clawed code. We're about to
completely get rid of Clay uh from our
entire tech stack. And the crazy part is
I don't even know how to write a single
line of code. Uh neither does James, my
right-hand guy, who actually built the
entire system and only learned Claude
code three weeks ago. We used Claude to
build a custom lead generation machine
that can process 272,000 leads per
second. That's 1 million leads in 5
seconds. At one point, we were even
Clay's largest user, hitting their
platform 17.3 million times per week.
And unfortunately, I love Clay, but it
couldn't keep up with our scale. So, we
had to build our own system. And it only
cost us $1966 [music]
a month to run. In this video, I'm going
to show you exactly how we did this. the
specific tools that we built and maybe
even how you can start building your own
lead generation system even if you've
never written a line of code in your
life. So, let's get into it. So, look,
all of this is like just really new and
one of my core principles is just
authenticity. So, this video is going to
be a little bit different. It's really
just going to be me just kind of talking
about a bunch of stuff. We're going to
go over to a bunch of different topics.
It's really just kind of be like a peak
behind the curtain like, hey, here's
here's kind of everything that we're
working on. And it's because I just
think this stuff is really really cool
and it's really really fun. you know,
why did we even have to build something
like this? The thing is is that we have
really started to outgrow every single
tool on the market. For Fixer AI alone,
we were processing 9 million leads a
month at peak. And the thing is, Clay,
once again, great. I love the product. I
think everybody should be using it. But
for us, you know, Clay limits you at
50,000 rows per table. And in your in
your entire workspace, you can only have
12.5 million rows in there. And on top
of that, when you delete some tables,
they like take a few days to actually
delete. And so, it's a really cumbersome
process. And [music] when you're
processing millions of leads like we do,
you're clicking run all thousands of
times and waiting for days for things to
properly clear out. It just it just
wasn't built for our scale. And you
know, the economics didn't make sense
either, right? Clay started playing
around with the idea of charging per
custom HTTP row and like custom columns.
Like, you know what? we need to get
ahead of this before it became a
problem. So that's why we decided to
build our own system. So about two
months ago, I started playing with
cursor and then more recently we
switched over to cloud code. Before we
made that switch, I had spent about
three grand in a month uh with cursor.
But when James and I were both doing it,
we were spending 450 bucks a day. And
then uh Ralph Loops came out with Claude
Code only a week or two ago. And it was
also way better and way cheaper. uh just
for claude code, it's $200 per month per
se, which is a no-brainer for us,
especially when compared to cursor. And
craziest thing is James, who had never
touched any of these tools before, built
out the entire core system in a week.
Here's what we are running, right? All
of our code sits inside inside of
GitHub. I don't even know what it was 2
months ago. And as as far as I can
understand, it's basically a cloud
storage system for code. Um, it keeps
everything organized and backed up so we
never lose our work. We also deploy
workers to railway. And railway is
really cool because you can I don't even
know a lot of these words, but you can
just you can deploy what's called
workers on here. And so they can
actually work through your code. So, for
example, if [snorts] I were to go into
uh this project here, right? Uh, we have
this guy. It's able to process
everything for us. It's just like code
in here. Once again, I don't even know
what the hell it's doing. Claude uh did
all of it, which is pretty rad. And the
craziest part is to use Railway. You can
see here, here is where our lead
processor sits. It's going to cost us
$2012,
which when I was in here earlier, it was
like $19, whatever I just said a few
minutes ago. But Railway kind of hosts
everything for us for when we need a lot
of processing. And I've used Railway
forever when we were using N. This is
like a special instance that I had that
was processing all of our workers. And
once again, I don't even know what the
hell this thing does, but it cranks. we
were able to process like 12 million
things uh per hour uh with with this
setup here. Railway is really really
dope uh for that. And so the thing is is
like these workers, right? You can think
of them as little robots [music] that
process our leads uh 247. And you know,
we have like 50 of them running at the
same time. So that's how we can actually
process leads so fast. And you might be
going, well, why is Clay so slow versus
you? It's like once again, it's nothing
like that's wrong with Clay. It's that
when you build something for yourself,
you can you can go crazy with that. and
it only has to be optimized to you and
if it errors you know you can just fix
it when it errors but if clay errors 1%
of the time that's hundreds of thousands
of users that are impacted which is not
good for them so they're completely
built for different things right and
then what we like to do is a lot of
these things is we also like to host
railway is cool because you can also
host uh Postgres databases on top of it
as well which is really rad the other
thing too is that we're looking at
convex right now just migrating from
Postgres over to convex but this is
where all of our lead data actually sits
our databases we store every single
lead, every single validation result,
every single enrichment. And we're
moving it to Convex because it seems to
it's going to be able to handle a little
bit more real-time data for what we're
doing. And this uh Convex isn't going to
be a solution for everything. So, for
example, for outfound.io uh which we're
working on. This is going to have like a
super custom, it's not going to be
convex, it's going to be postgres
database. It's built completely
differently. And right now, I would not
be able to vibe code something like
outound. We're working with um our
developer stimuli. We've co-ounded out
together. And so that's going to be a
completely different uh thing. But
what's great about it is it's going to
have like a lead database for everybody
uh to be able to use. But what I mean I
wouldn't be surprised if in a year or
two a model actually could do what
Alfound is setting out to do, right? Uh
we have front-end components that deploy
on Versell and Verscell just hosts all
of our code in a really cool way. And so
what it does is it deploys it. And so
Versell hosts all of our dashboards and
any visual interfaces we built. It like
syncs up with GitHub. Whenever we push
like whenever Claude pushes new code, it
loads into there and I can preview it
inside of it, right? And so this is what
we can really see what's happening with
all of our campaigns. Once again, our
railway bill is like super low. Our most
expensive thing is claw and it's only
200 bucks a month and then everything
past that makes it really, really,
really cool. And the speed difference
is, you know, crazy, right? With Clay,
if I wanted to process 1 million leads,
it would take 27 hours. And if that was
if it was perfect and it would error out
often enough to where we'd have to rerun
stuff. So you're multiplying how many
hours you're having to do in order to do
that. And with our system, we can
process 272,000 rows per second. That's
a million leads in 5 seconds versus 27
hours, right? And so what's great about
that is when a campaign isn't working,
we can now pivot and reload new lists
almost instantly, which no one else can
do that. They have no idea like what
kind of problems you're going to run
into when you even think about sending
more than 100,000 emails a month. Even
even then, most people can't even send
100,000 emails a month like we do at
like entry level. By the way, if you're
watching this and thinking, "This sounds
like a lot to build myself." That's
exactly why companies partner with us.
We have built all of this. And if you
want us to handle your entire cold email
system, click the first link in the
description to book a free intro call.
But let's let's continue. So, that's
really the foundation. Now, let me show
you the specific tools we built on top
of this. These are things we once again
just vibe coded with cursor or claude
code, and each one of them solves
different lead generation problems. And
James once again gets a lot of credit
for uh doing these ones so well. So
here's something that James built that
is really damn cool with a front-end UR
entire team uh can use as well. So we
built a custom Google map scraper for
local business leads. The trick with
lead scraping with Google Maps is to do
it zip code by zip code instead of like
by city or by state. But the thing is is
that there's over I think it's 32,000
uh zip codes. And so that way you can
actually get a result for every single
query. And James built this encursor
with like 3 four hours of work. And you
see once we have the companies from
Google Maps, we run an AI enrichment to
find those contacts. This AI will scrape
any public database it can find to
locate contacts at the company. And we
run that through another AI layer to
segment it further. So for example, are
they a multilocation medical practice?
Have they been in business for 20 years?
It's able to find each one of those
things and research it and have
confidence scores. And so that lets us
narrow down exactly to the right ICP
before we ever reach out. And you know,
the cost is pretty insane, right?
Typically for each company, we want to
find three leads. And the entire
enrichment process costs a fifth of a
penny. That's 0.00.2
cents to find three qualified leads,
which is really rad. Now, so a little
bit more about that AI leader. We did
the Google map scrape and then we're
like, you know what? Let's take this AI
leader and put it on our regular uh
process. So this doesn't just work for
Google scrapes. We can use AI to find
anybody who's on the internet at all.
So, what we do is when we pull data from
AR Arc, who's one of our favorite
vendors now, we just recently found them
and they've basically completely
replaced Apollo for us. If AR Arc
doesn't have a match for the company, we
will often find contacts through this AI
search. So, if we don't find a lead at
that company, it'll go search out and
it's always trying to find three more,
which is really huge. And the other
thing we did in it too, if it can't find
a valid email for Joe, it'll go, okay,
does Joe have any other valid emails?
And so it'll look at personal email
addresses or maybe they have a different
another job that they also work at or
like with high level talent. Oftent
times they're there maybe partners or
consultants at multiple different
companies. And so we'll go through one
of their other emails to talk to them
about this opportunity for a company
they work. So that one's really really
cool. And so we run it for every single
company where we didn't get information
from um our initial um extraction. And
once again, the AR is searching the
entire internet to find leads for this.
So it'll return LinkedIn profiles,
confidence level, and reasoning for why
each lead is a good fit. You know, then
we take a look at that LinkedIn URL and
run it through our normal waterfall
process in order to get the email.
[music] Uh the reason that this matters
is we get a massive uplift on campaigns
where typical data sources will come up
empty. So for example, if you go to like
Apollo or LinkedIn directly, you might
get like 30% of a list by the end of the
day validated. And we're able to get
that to above like 95% of contacts that
we're trying to find with a valid email,
which is uh really, really, really cool.
It does sometimes confuse our clients
because they'll be like, "Oh, Joe
replied at this one company. He's not
even an ideal customer profile." And
I'll be like, "Yeah, but like look at
his profile. You see his his other job
that he has is actually a perfect fit."
And they're like, "Oh that's
really cool." Anyways, the next thing is
that we've also built like ad library
scrapers. With this system, we can
scrape uh libraries at scale. So we
built some for Google and for LinkedIn
ad libraries and we can find everybody
who's running ads on Google or LinkedIn
in the last like 30 days, 60 days,
whatever threshold we set and it creates
extremely qualified lists. I mean we can
even filter it by like how many ads has
the company been running and you know if
the company is running ads they're
actively trying to grow. They're usually
pretty good targeting for a lot of our
clients kind of regardless if they if
they have an ad product or not. They
probably have a budget set aside
allocated for client acquisition. So,
these are much warmer leads than
somebody who's not investing in growth
at all. And nobody else has it um
especially at the scale uh that we're
running at, right? One of the other cool
things that we built is an executive
summary system. It's basically an AI
system that analyzes all of our
campaigns and gives me and James a daily
report on everything that we should be
thinking about and everything that we
should be uh processing [music]
here. This is just giving us a snapshot
of 15 randomly uh selected clients,
giving us our average rates at scale,
like what is everything that we did,
analyzing all of our email to lead
ratios, how many meetings have been
generated from those specific campaigns
as well. And then we also are are doing
other things right now where we're like
analyzing a copy [music] of a campaign
where like we're going eventually I want
to get to a spot very very soon where I
can go cool if I want to talk to the
director of marketing at a a paper
manufacturing company. What are all of
the things in the copy that are going to
be going to need to be in there in order
to give us the highest multiplier on
campaign efficacy for them? This whole
system it takes a template of every
email we send and matches it to a
schema. Right? to take subject lines,
question, curiosity statements, [music]
AI personalization. It looks at the hook
type, is it a CTA? It looks at the body
messaging categories, it looks at the
social proof categories, and it also
categorizes the ICP for every client.
And it uh generates those
recommendations. And so that's something
that like we're working on right now,
right now. That's really badass. And
these will be reports that our clients
get every single week very soon. And it
looks at all of our sends from the last
week plus all of our historicals data
for the clients. It'll look at what's
working for other ICPS that we might be
able to adopt to them. And then it
creates that executive summary. Ideally,
it'll be like, "Hey, for this ICP, this
type of subject lines are winning based
on this. Here's what we should do next."
And then the system takes all of this
data and programmatically creates
campaigns as well as something that
we're putting together. Another thing we
built is we've it'll automatically clean
out our instantly workspaces cuz they
bill you for how many leads you put in,
unlike like smart lead or email bison,
which we really like. And actually,
we're looking at moving everything over
to email bison just because of that
particular pain point. But either way,
it deletes all the leads from the
campaigns. It loads in the proper lead
list. It keeps track of everything and
it sends us a really pretty report every
Friday which is why we call it Friday
analytics. All right, so the next thing
is we have a lead database, right? We
have our own private lead database with
almost 50 million leads inside of it
now. And we catalog every single lead
that we ever pull for every client if it
doesn't violate like an NDA that we have
with a particular client or anything
like that. And so because of that, we
most of the time we don't even have to
buy new data. We only need to fetch new
people that have entered the
marketplace. We can also analyze which
data fender has the most valid data for
each ICP. And so here you see a bunch of
zeros. This is not a production
instance. This is actually a development
instance right now. So it has a bunch of
just like example data. It doesn't have
real data inside of it yet. But you can
see here this is the general idea of it.
Right? So like we'd be able to analyze
which leads where did they come from and
then we'll be able to extrapolate
results from all of those. will be able
to real time in real time to compare all
of our data vendors which will be really
cool because lead magic might have the
best data for cyber security while Wiza
performs better for e-commerce right and
this lets us optimize our waterfall for
each specific client and industry these
lists are managed all automatically and
so when a client gets low on leads our
system automatically deletes the old
leads from instantly and uploads the new
leads to the campaign so we don't get
charged for storing leads that aren't
being emailed [music] and so it's like
actually saves us a ton of money on our
instantly bill which is really really
huge Because of that automatic refill,
we also know that clients will never run
out of leads. And so the whole thing
just runs on autopilot. And the other
thing I'll tell you, right, is that a
lot of these things that we're vibe
coding ourselves are so cool that we're
actually looking right now, all of these
features to be put into Outfound if and
when we decide to release Outfound.io to
the public. So stay tuned for that. And
you know, I I get it. You don't need to
be a developer to do this. Obviously,
that's I'm an example of that. But it
can still be a lot, right? But Claude
Code has completely changed what's
possible. Um, I bought licenses for my
entire team, including my executive
assistant. We got rid of cursor, popped
in Cloud Code, and she'll even use it
just to process CSVs faster. It's the
best dollar I think we can possibly
spend. And the other tip I would give is
I recommend you just start like with one
pain point. Don't try to build like
everything at once. Try to just build
like one thing that like just saves you
a little bit of time or is like your
most time-consuming thing that you
think, hey, I could probably code on how
to do yourself. and uh pick the thing
that's slowing you down the most. You
know, for us, it was the processing
speed of row limits. It was the biggest
bottleneck of our business whenever we
were doing high volume is we'd have to
do a bunch of pre-work for a month to
actually get the leads ready. Now, we
don't need a month. We just need a few
days, which is just huge for us being
able to launch, you know, I mean, we
have clients that launch for 100K a
month on our accelerator plan to send 5
million emails and we launch them within
1 to 3 weeks of them signing the
contract, which is just mind-blowing. If
you know, you know when it comes to that
and so yeah, so for us it was about
processing speed and road limits and
things like that. So we built the
solution for that and then we expanded
to the next thing and then built a
solution for that. When you want to
integrate with something just you can
just ask claude code too at any time
like hey how can I do this? It'll still
take a lot of time. the tools aren't
perfect, but we're willing to put that
time in on the front end because with
automations, we get a lot of our time
back in the future and we're trying to
be extremely leveraged with everything
uh that we're doing, right? And so you
can just ask cloud code like go get the
API for lead magic and can you walk me
through how to set this up? It'll
literally tell you step by step. Just
ask it really good questions and be
willing to learn. And you know, you
don't need to understand the code. You
just need to know what you want to
accomplish. And of course, be careful.
It's not like I would ever release these
apps to the public. They're really great
for our private internal tools. You
know, I don't know how security works on
all of this stuff yet, but internally, I
put some, you know, work OS for
authentication on top of it, and I'm
pretty good with how that is. And so, if
you're running or want to run cold email
at scale without hitting limits, paying
too much, or waiting hours to process
leads, there really two paths forward,
right? You can build your own systems
just like we did. Start with cloud code,
pick your biggest pain point, and start
solving it in one piece at a time. Or if
you just want the benefit of everything
we're building without having to build
it yourself, click the first link in the
description and book a free intro call
with us. We've helped companies like
RB2B scale to $4 million in annual
reoccurring revenue in only 4 months.
And 42% of the revenue came from our
cold emails. We built a machine that
generated $4.3 million in annual
pipeline for Fixer AI. And if we would
have hit their total addressable market
every 60 days, that would have generated
$32.2 million in annual reoccurring for
them. That's signups to paid
conversions. Just absolutely insane. And
we also help companies like Directive
Consulting book 15 to 20 meetings every
single day through cold email. So again,
click the first link below and book your
intro call with us. If you want to see
the full breakdown of our cold email
machine that was sending 8.8 million
emails per month and was making Fixer AI
$4.3 million a year and could have made
them $32.2 $2 million a year, then watch
