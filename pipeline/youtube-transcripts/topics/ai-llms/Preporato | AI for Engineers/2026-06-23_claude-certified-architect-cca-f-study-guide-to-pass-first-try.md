Cloud Certified Architect is Anthropic's
first certification, and I am here today
to help you pass it with flying colors.
In this video, I will give you the
foundational understanding of how to
prepare for this certificate, where the
main pitfalls are that people fall into
during the exam, and how you can
guarantee your readiness by following a
few basic rules. Once you start the
exam, you will see 60 multiple-choice
scenario-based questions, and you need
at least 75% of them correct to pass.
For those questions, Anthropic has
written six production scenarios. The
system picks four at random and serves
them to you, and every one of your 60
questions is anchored to one of those
four.
Every question drops you into a working
system, often one that is already
breaking, and asks which architectural
decision is right given the specific
circumstances.
To cover all 60, you have about 2
minutes per question to stay on track.
Let's go a bit deeper into the specific
domains.
Before we go domain by domain, lock in
what Claude actually is as a system,
because the test assumes you already
know. At the bottom of every Anthropic
product, there is one thing: a language
model behind a single HTTP endpoint at
api.anthropic.com/v1/messages.
You send it a list of messages, you get
back a response. The model has no memory
between calls, it does not run loops,
and it does not execute code. That
endpoint plus those three facts is the
entire engine.
Everything else is a layer of discipline
wrapped around that endpoint, and there
are four of them you have to recognize
by name, because each one is what one or
two of the domains tests directly.
The Claude API is the raw HTTP endpoint
plus the official Python and TypeScript
SDKs that wrap it.
The Agent SDK is the framework Anthropic
ships on top of the API that runs the
agent loop, spawns sub agents, and
provides built-in tools so you do not
rebuild them by hand.
Claude Code is the terminal agent that
boots Claude inside your repository and
gives it file system access through
read, write, edit, bash, and grep.
And MCP, the Model Context Protocol, is
the open standard for how external tools
and data sources expose themselves to
any compliant model, so the same payment
processor or internal wiki or database
plugin works across all four surfaces
without rewriting glue code.
Now the map. Domain one and parts of
domain three live on the API and the
agent SDK. Domain two is Claude Code.
Domain four is MCP. Domain five sits
across all of them because reliability
is a property of the whole system.
Hold that picture in your head and every
scenario the exam throws at you is just
a question about which surface owns the
broken behavior.
Domain one, agentic architecture and
orchestration, the heaviest domain at
27%.
Claude is stateless. It does not
remember the last call you made, it does
not run a loop on Anthropic side, and it
does not execute tools by itself. Every
time you want Claude to do multi-step
work, your code is the loop. When you
call the messages.create endpoint and
pass Claude a list of tools it is
allowed to use, the response comes back
with a field called stop reason.
Two values on that field decide what
your code does next. If stop reason
equals end turn, Claude is done thinking
and the response text is the final
answer.
If stop reason equals tool use, Claude
has paused mid-thought and is asking
your code to run a function on its
behalf.
You pull the function name and arguments
off the response, you execute that
function locally, you append the result
back to the conversation history as a
tool result message, and you call
messages.create again with the updated
history. Claude picks up where it left
off and either calls another tool or
finishes. That cycle, call inspect
execute append call, is the entire
agent. Drop the inspect step and the
agent goes silent after one tool call.
Drop the append step and the model loses
the result and tries the same tool a
second time.
At least four of your 60 questions hand
you a code snippet where one of those
steps is missing and the answer always
names the broken step directly.
The second half of this domain is what
happens when a single Claude is not
enough. A top-level Claude, the
coordinator, breaks a job into pieces
and spawns smaller scoped Claude's
called sub agents to handle each one.
The coordinator spawns them through a
built-in function in the agent SDK
called the task tool.
The whole reason for the pattern is
context budget.
A coordinator that has to read 10 files,
run five searches, and draft a summary
will fill its own context window long
before it finishes. By spawning a sub
agent for each file read, the
coordinator gets back only the sub
agent's compact summary and keeps its
own context lean.
Two decomposition styles to know.
Sequential decomposition means the
coordinator finishes sub agent one
before spawning sub agent two, and it is
the right call when each step depends on
the previous step's output.
Adaptive decomposition means the
coordinator picks the next sub agent
based on what came back, and it is the
right call for open-ended work like
investigating a competitor's pricing
strategy.
And when one sub-agent fails halfway
through, the right recovery is almost
always a targeted retry of just the
failed one. Because the successful
sub-agents may have already written rows
to a database or fired off emails, and
you do not want to fire those a second
time.
Domain two, Claude code configuration
and workflows, 20%.
Claude code is the terminal agent that
runs Claude directly inside your
repository. And by default, every new
session starts with zero memory of your
project.
Claude.md is the file that fixes that.
When Claude code boots, it walks up the
directory tree from your current folder,
finds every file along the way named
Claude.md,
and stitches them into the session's
system prompt.
The hierarchy sits at three levels, and
the exam will absolutely test you on
putting a rule in the wrong one.
The user level file lives at
tilde/.claude/claude.md.
It applies to every project on your
laptop, and never goes into version
control. So, anything there is for you
alone.
The project level file sits at the repo
root, gets committed to get, and ships
with every clone, which is where
team-wide conventions go. Like, everyone
uses bun instead of npm.
And the directory level file sits inside
a sub-package, like
packages/api/claude.md,
for rules that should only apply when
Claude is touching code in that specific
folder.
The exam loves to ask where the rule
that everyone must run lint before
commit should live.
The answer is the project file at the
repo root.
Putting it in your user file means your
teammates' clone never sees it.
Custom slash commands are the second
piece. A slash command is a reusable
prompt you invoke by typing a forward
slash like slash review. You define one
by dropping a markdown file into dot
Claude slash commands. The body of that
file is the prompt that gets injected
when the command runs.
The YAML front matter at the top is
where you constrain how it behaves.
The allowed tools field restricts which
cloud code tools the command can call.
So a review command can be locked to
read only tools like read and grep with
no write or bash access.
The argument hint field is the
placeholder shown in the picker. So it
documents what argument the command
expects.
And then there is headless CICD. Claude
code takes a flag {dash} p that runs it
non-interactively with a prompt baked
in. Combined with a structured output
schema, this lets your pipeline ask
Claude to review a pull request and
return a JSON object with named
violation categories.
The architectural lesson the exam keeps
coming back to is that your pipeline
should fail only on categories the
schema can name explicitly like security
violation or breaking API change.
A pipeline that fails whenever Claude
expresses vague concern produces noise
the team tunes out within a week.
And a Claude review the team tunes out
is worse than no review at all.
Domain three, prompt engineering and
structured output, also 20%.
Vague instructions are ambiguous
instructions.
When you tell Claude to review this PR
carefully, the model has no shared
definition of the word careful. So it
flags anything in the diff that pattern
matches to caution, which is essentially
everything, which is why your inbox
fills with false positives the same
afternoon.
The fix is to swap every adjective in
the prompt for a list of categorical
mechanically checkable rules. Instead of
review carefully, you write flag if any
function exceeds 40 lines. Flag if any
new third-party dependency is added.
Flag if a public type signature is
removed. Each rule has a yes or no
answer the model can compute by reading
the diff, and the false positive rate
drops sharply. Pillar two of this domain
is structured output. Your downstream
code expects JSON, and the model
produces text.
The naive way is to write return JSON in
the prompt and hope that Claude will
comply
most of the time.
Right up until the morning it prepends a
friendly "Sure, here is your JSON." And
your parser explodes in production at
3:00 in the afternoon.
The reliable way is to declare your
output shape as a tool. You define a
tool in the Anthropic SDK whose
input_schema
field describes the JSON shape you want.
You pass it in the tools array, and you
set tool choice to force the model to
call that one tool.
Instead of free text, the model returns
a tool use block whose input field
contains your schema compliant JSON.
This works dramatically better because
Anthropic fine-tuned Claude hard against
tool schemas, so its compliance rate on
tool use inputs sits much higher than on
free text format instructions.
Even with tool use, schemas drift
sometimes, and the pattern for handling
that is a validation and retry loop. On
every response, you run the returned
JSON through your schema validator.
When validation fails, you do not retry
blindly.
You take the validator's error message,
append it to the conversation as a user
turn that says, "Your previous response
failed validation with this specific
error. Please return a corrected
response."
And you call the model again.
The model now has its own previous
output and the exact field that broke in
context. And the correction rate on the
second attempt sits above 90% in
practice.
The last beat is batch processing. The
message batches API lets you submit
thousands of independent prompts and
pick up the results within 24 hours at
50% of the per-token cost of real-time
calls.
The exam hands you a scenario about
classifying 100,000 documents overnight
and asks whether to loop or batch.
Batches are the right call whenever the
work is offline, latency is measured in
hours, and the prompts are independent,
so order does not matter.
Domain four,
tool design and MCP integration,
18%.
MCP stands for model context protocol,
an open standard Anthropic published for
how external tools and data sources
expose themselves to a language model.
Before MCP, every tool integration was a
one-off wrapper specific to one model.
With MCP, the model speaks a single
protocol, and any compliant server, a
database, a wiki, a payment processor,
your internal API, plugs in and the
model can call it without changes to the
model code.
Three things to learn deeply.
First, tool descriptions decide whether
the model picks the right tool.
At decision time, the only thing the
model sees is each tool's name, its
description, and its input schema.
If you ship three tools called get user,
look up user, and find customer, all
described as returns user information,
the model picks essentially at random,
and the exam scores that as a schema
defect. The tool definitions have to
solve.
The fix is to write tool descriptions
the way you write API docs.
One sentence on what the tool does.
One sentence on when to use this one
over its siblings, so the model has a
disambiguation rule.
One example invocation with realistic
arguments.
And a list of error conditions the tool
can return.
Second, structured error responses.
When a tool fails, the right shape is a
JSON object the model can branch on.
An is error boolean, so it knows it hit
an error path.
A category string, like rate limited or
not found, so it can pick a recovery
branch by name.
A retryable boolean, so it knows whether
to retry.
And when applicable, a retry after MS
integer, so it knows how long to wait.
With that shape, the model writes a
clean recovery plan in one step.
Without it, the model gets a raw
exception string and either gives up or
starts an infinite retry loop you find
later in the logs at 3:00 in the
morning.
Third, transport selection.
MCP supports two transports.
The STDO transport runs the server in
the same process tree as the client over
standard input and output. Zero network
latency, zero authentication overhead,
and it is the default whenever the
server can live on the same machine.
The SSE transport, server-sent events,
runs the server on a different host, and
the client connects over HTTP, which
adds network round trips and forces you
to design an authentication scheme.
The rule the exam keeps testing is
direct. Pick STDI whenever the server
can live on the same machine as the
client. Pick SSE only when the server
has to live somewhere else, like a
centralized database connector serving
multiple users from a shared host.
Domain five,
context management and reliability,
15%.
Concept one,
the lost in the middle effect.
This is an empirical finding from
research on long context language models
that is held across every model family,
including Claude.
When you stuff a long conversation or
document into a context window, the
model pays the most attention to
whatever sits at the very start and the
very end, and almost none to whatever
sits in the middle.
The exam exploits this directly. A
customer support agent has been chatting
for 40 turns and is suddenly forgetting
that the account number was given in
turn three.
The right fix is to identify the durable
facts, things like account numbers,
order IDs, and refund amounts, copy them
into a small structured block of text,
often called a case block, and re-anchor
that block at the very end of the
context on every turn, so the model's
attention always lands on it.
The tempting move is to ask the model to
summarize the whole conversation, and
that is exactly the distractor the exam
puts in front of you. Because
summarization compresses with lossy
heuristics and silently drops numbers
and IDs.
Concept two, prompt caching.
Every input token you send costs money.
And if you send the same 50,000 token
system prompt on every call, you pay
full price for it every time.
Prompt caching fixes that.
You add a cash control breakpoint at the
end of any prompt section you want to
reuse, like your system prompt or your
few-shot examples, and Anthropic caches
the model's internal state at that point
for the next 5 minutes.
Calls that reuse the exact same prefix
pay roughly 1/10 of the input price on
the cached portion.
The architectural lesson is what is
worth caching. The system prompt is
worth caching because it is identical on
every call. Few-shot examples are worth
caching for the same reason. The user
turn at the end is not worth caching
because every user types something
different, and caching it just burns the
budget on entries that never hit again.
Concept three,
escalation.
Reliable agents have to know when they
do not know.
The exam treats an agent that
confidently answers a question it should
have escalated as a worse failure than
an agent that escalates a little too
eagerly.
The first ships bad answers to
customers.
The second just costs you a few extra
human review tickets, and that is a
trade you take all day.
The pattern to recognize is an explicit
confidence check at the end of the
agent's reasoning with two triggers.
Either the model's stated confidence
falls below a defined threshold, or the
model detects ambiguity it cannot
resolve from the conversation history.
Either trigger hands the conversation
off to a human along with a structured
summary of what the agent knew, what it
tried, and where it got stuck.
Anthropic has published six production
scenarios. The proctor picks four at
random and serves them to you. You study
all six because you do not get to
choose, and you also want to know which
domains tend to attach to which scenario
because that is what makes the question
pool predictable.
The customer support agent scenario is
where most of the agentic architecture
questions land. Escalation, retries, and
partial failure handling get tested
there hardest.
Claude code team integration is where
the Claude.md hierarchy and slash
commands get tested.
The multi-agent research pipeline is
where coordinator and sub-agent
orchestration shows up, and it is the
most likely scenario to throw a context
overflow question at you.
Developer productivity tools sits on the
built-in read, write, edit, bash, grep,
and glob tools, and on when to reach for
an MCP server instead of writing your
own.
Claude code in CICD covers headless
invocation, structured output, and false
positive minimization. Structured data
extraction is the JSON schema and
message batches scenario.
Two of those six will not show up on
your exam. You do not know which two.
Four weeks and every resource in this
plan already lives. Each week runs the
same rhythm. You read the domain guide
for the theory. You build the matching
graded project for the reps. And you run
the 500 card deck for 15 minutes every
day to keep recall sharp. The six
practice exams are your weekly
checkpoints, and the domain weights
decide where your hours go.
Week one is agentic architecture, the
heaviest domain at 27%, so it earns the
most time.
Read the agentic architecture guide,
then build two of the graded projects,
the agent loop with safe termination and
the hub and spoke orchestrator where you
force a sub agent to fail and write the
recovery path yourself.
Close the week with practice exam one as
your baseline and do not flinch at the
score because that number exists only to
show you what the next 3 weeks have to
fix.
Week two is the 40% block, Claude code
configuration and prompt engineering
side by side. Read both domain guides
and the cheat sheet, then build the
Claude code skill and command project
and the prompt and a vowel project where
you turn one vague prompt into a
numbered rule prompt and prove the gain
with a real evaluation.
Run practice exams two and three as your
checkpoints since both lean straight
into these two domains.
Week three is tool design and the model
context protocol. Read the MCP
architecture guide, then build the full
MCP server project end to end with real
tools, complete descriptions, structured
errors, and secrets pulled from
environment variables, and Claude
connected as the client.
Finish with practice exam five, the
anti-pattern set, because most tool
questions are really checking whether
you can spot the broken contract.
Week four is context management and your
dress rehearsal. Build the long context
project with crash recovery and the
compaction project and confirm a single
cash control breakpoint drops the cost
on the cashed portion to roughly 1/10.
Then sit practice exams four and six
back to back under the full 2-hour timer
because that timer is the part most
candidates skip in practice and lose 10
points to on exam day.
Five distractor patterns to recognize on
site because every one of them shows up
more than once across the question pool
so the viewer feels these traps are
unavoidable.
The vague adjective trap is any option
that sticks careful or thorough into a
prompt to fix a false positive problem.
The graded answer uses a numbered list
of categorical rules the model can check
one at a time.
The summarization trap is any option
that compresses a long conversation in a
scenario where it carries IDs and
amounts.
The graded answer extracts the durable
facts into a case block at the end of
the window.
The blanket retry trap is any option
that reruns every sub agent after one
fails when the others already executed
side effects. The graded answer retries
only the failed one.
The user claw.md trap is any option that
puts team shared configuration in the
user level file in your home directory,
which never reaches version control.
The graded answer puts shared rules in
the project file at the repo root.
And the SSE on localhost trap is any
option that picks SSE transport for a
server running on the same machine as
its client. The graded answer picks
STDIO.
You are going to walk in there and the
exam is going to be fair because it
rewards exactly what you have actually
built.
So, go build it.
Spend the four weeks the plan lays out.
Sit the two timed mocks even when they
feel pointless on a Sunday afternoon.
And on exam day, show up to the proctor
room a little early. Take a breath and
remember that every scenario on the
screen is something you already debugged
in your own terminal.
By the time you hit submit on question
60, the result is already decided by the
four weeks you put in.
Go pass it.
