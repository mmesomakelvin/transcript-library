# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** The library must stay fast and trustworthy for private knowledge browsing and analysis, even as the catalog grows and runtime analysis moves onto a hosted Proxmox container.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - SQLite Catalog

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (SQLite Catalog)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready for next phase
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — Completed Plan 03 (legacy artifact migration)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 10 min
- Total execution time: 32 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase                   | Plans | Total  | Avg/Plan |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 01-artifact-foundations | 3     | 32 min | 10 min   |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 4 min, 8 min, 20 min
- Trend: Mixed
  | Phase 01-artifact-foundations P02 | 8 min | 3 tasks | 12 files |
  | Phase 01-artifact-foundations P03 | 20 min | 3 tasks | 20 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1 setup: Keep the current UI direction stable and focus this cycle on architecture and runtime hardening.
- Phase 1 setup: Treat configurable insights storage and structured `analysis.json` as deployment-unblocking prerequisites.
- Phase 2 setup: Move catalog indexing from CSV to SQLite now instead of deferring the storage decision.
- [Phase 01-artifact-foundations]: Use Vitest as the minimal node-focused harness for artifact path regressions
- [Phase 01-artifact-foundations]: Keep src/lib/analysis.ts as the single runtime authority for insight root resolution and videoId path validation
- [Phase 01-artifact-foundations]: Treat structured JSON as the write-time authority and reject invalid payloads before UI consumption.
- [Phase 01-artifact-foundations]: Derive analysis.md from validated reportMarkdown while keeping analysis.json authoritative for structured sections.
- [Phase 01-artifact-foundations]: Keep legacy markdown fallback during migration, but fail loudly when analysis.json exists and is invalid.
- [Phase 01-artifact-foundations]: Gate markdown-only fallback on .migration-status.json so legacy compatibility stays explicitly temporary.
- [Phase 01-artifact-foundations]: Share artifact path resolution through src/lib/insight-paths.ts so plain-node maintenance scripts and runtime use the same base-dir/videoId authority.
- [Phase 01-artifact-foundations]: Treat zero remaining flat markdown artifacts as the operational completion signal for Phase 1 migration.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Active scope is broad; if execution granularity becomes too large, descale by leverage instead of mixing unrelated fixes into a single phase.
